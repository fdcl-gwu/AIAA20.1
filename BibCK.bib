abstract = {The ability to exert real-time, adaptive control of transportation processes is the core of many intelligent transportation systems decision support tools. Reinforcement learning, an artificial intelligence approach undergoing development in the machine-learning community, offers key advantages in this regard. The ability of a control agent to learn relationships between control actions and their effect on the environment while pursuing a goal is a distinct improvement over prespecified models of the environment. Prespecified models are a prerequisite of conventional control methods and their accuracy limits the performance of control agents. This paper contains an introduction to Q-learning, a simple yet powerful reinforcement learning algorithm, and presents a case study involving application to traffic signal control. Encouraging results of the application to an isolated traffic signal, particularly under variable traffic conditions, are presented. A broader research effort is outlined, 
including extension to linear and networked signal systems and integration with dynamic route guidance. The research objective involves optimal control of heavily congested traffic across a two-dimensional road network-a challenging task for conventional traffic signal control methodologies.},

abstract = {Numerical simulations have been used to analyze the effect that vortices, shed from one flapping foil, have on the thrust of another flapping foil placed directly downstream. The simulations attempt to model the dorsal–tail fin interaction observed in a swimming bluegill sunfish. The simulations have been carried out using a Cartesian grid method that allows us to simulate flows with complex moving boundaries on stationary Cartesian grids. The simulations indicate that vortex shedding from the upstream (dorsal) fin is indeed capable of increasing the thrust of the downstream (tail) fin significantly. Vortex structures shed by the upstream dorsal fin increase the effective angle-of-attack of the flow seen by the tail fin and initiate the formation of a strong leading edge stall vortex on the downstream fin. This stall vortex convects down the surface of the tail and the low pressure associated with this vortex increases the thrust on the downstream tail fin. However, this thrust augmentation is found to be quite sensitive to the phase relationship between the two flapping fins. The numerical simulations allows us to examine in detail, the underlying physical mechanism for this thrust augmentation.},

abstract = {The classical theory of high-speed flow predicts that a moving rigid object experiences a drag proportional to the square of its speed. However, this reasoning does not apply if the object in the flow is flexible, because its shape then becomes a function of its speed--for example, the rolling up of broad tree leaves in a stiff wind. The reconfiguration of bodies by fluid forces is common in nature, and can result in a substantial drag reduction that is beneficial for many organisms. Experimental studies of such flow-structure interactions generally lack a theoretical interpretation that unifies the body and flow mechanics. Here we use a flexible fibre immersed in a flowing soap film to measure the drag reduction that arises from bending of the fibre by the flow. Using a model that couples hydrodynamics to bending, we predict a reduced drag growth compared to the classical theory. The fibre undergoes a bending transition, producing shapes that are self-similar; for such configurations, the drag scales with the length of self-similarity, rather than the fibre profile width. These predictions are supported by our experimental data.},

abstract = {During their 5-mo overwintering period in Mexico, tens of millions of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) form dense aggregations in forests dominated by oyamel fir trees (Abies religiosa). These forests provide a cool, moist environment that most monarchs use to maintain a state of reproductive diapause and to remain largely inactive until March, when they migrate back to the southern United States. In 1986, the Mexican government created the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve (MBSBR), but it is under pressure to allow forest extractions from core areas of the reserve. A recent argument to justify logging maintains that tree extraction would benefit monarchs by creating forest openings in which more plants would flower. The increased availability of nectar might mean that fewer monarchs would deplete their lipid contents, and therefore, more monarchs would survive the overwintering period. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing, throughout the overwintering period, lipid utilization and three other physical characteristics of monarch butterflies that were clustered on trees vs. monarchs that were collected while they visited flowers. Comparisons were also made with autumn migrants collected in Texas, successful spring migrants collected in the southern United States, and reproductively active summer generations collected in Wisconsin and Minnesota. We also examined changes in lipid mass during the annual cycle of eastern North American monarch populations. We found that clustered butterflies had significantly higher lipid mass, water content, lean mass, and larger wings than did monarchs collected from flowers. These differences were consistent throughout the overwintering period. Clustered monarchs consumed their lipid reserves passively in relation to the ambient temperature, as would be expected based on their resting metabolic rate. In contrast, a high proportion of flower-visiting monarchs had lipid masses close to zero; very few had medium or high lipid levels. This suggests that flower-visiting monarchs either maintained their lipid reserves at low levels by visiting flowers, but were unable to reach levels found in clustered monarchs, or that, as the flower-visiting monarchs died, clustered monarchs with low lipid reserves departed from their roosting trees to visit flowers. Migrating monarchs collected in April in the southern United Stales had significantly higher Lipid masses than did flower-visiting monarchs collected in M{\ldots}},

abstract = {In this paper, we present online model-free adaptive critic (AC) schemes based on approximate dynamic programming (ADP) to solve optimal control problems in both discrete-time and continuous-time domains for linear systems with unknown dynamics. In the discrete-time case, it is shown that the proposed ADP algorithm is in fact solving the underlying Generalized Algebraic Riccati Equation (GARE) of the corresponding optimal control problem or zero-sum game. In the continuous-time domain, an ADP scheme is introduced to solve for the underlying ARE of the optimal control problem. It is shown that this continuous-time ADP scheme is in fact a Quasi-Newton method to solve the ARE. In both time domains, the adaptive critic algorithms are easy to initialize since initial policies are not required to be stabilizing. It is also shown, on a power system control example, that both discrete-time and continuous-time approaches to ADP converge to the same continuous time optimal control solution provided that 
the utility function is appropriately chosen. {\&}copy;2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Most insects are thought to fly by creating a leading-edge vortex that remains attached to the wing as it translates through a stroke. In the species examined so far, stroke amplitude is large, and most of the aerodynamic force is produced halfway through a stroke when translation velocities are highest. Here we demonstrate that honeybees use an alternative strategy, hovering with relatively low stroke amplitude (approximately 90 degrees) and high wingbeat frequency (approximately 230 Hz). When measured on a dynamically scaled robot, the kinematics of honeybee wings generate prominent force peaks during the beginning, middle, and end of each stroke, indicating the importance of additional unsteady mechanisms at stroke reversal. When challenged to fly in low-density heliox, bees responded by maintaining nearly constant wingbeat frequency while increasing stroke amplitude by nearly 50{\%}. We examined the aerodynamic consequences of this change in wing motion by using artificial kinematic patterns in which amplitude was systematically increased in 5 degrees increments. To separate the aerodynamic effects of stroke velocity from those due to amplitude, we performed this analysis under both constant frequency and constant velocity conditions. The results indicate that unsteady forces during stroke reversal make a large contribution to net upward force during hovering but play a diminished role as the animal increases stroke amplitude and flight power. We suggest that the peculiar kinematics of bees may reflect either a specialization for increasing load capacity or a physiological limitation of their flight muscles.},

abstract = {Hovering flight is one of the most energetically demanding forms of animal locomotion. Despite the cost, hummingbirds regularly hover at high elevations, where flight is doubly challenging because of reduced air density and oxygen availability. We performed three laboratory experiments to examine how air density and oxygen partial pressure influence wingbeat kinematics. In the first study, we experimentally lowered air density but maintained constant oxygen partial pressure. Under these hypodense but normoxic conditions, hummingbirds increased stroke amplitude substantially and increased wingbeat frequency slightly. In the second experiment, we maintained constant air density but decreased oxygen partial pressure. Under these normodense but hypoxic conditions, hummingbirds did not alter stroke amplitude but instead reduced wingbeat frequency until they could no longer generate enough vertical force to offset body weight. In a final combined experiment, we decreased air density but increased oxygen availability, and found that the wingbeat kinematics were unaffected by supplemental oxygen. We also studied hovering and maximally loaded flight performance for 43 hummingbird species distributed along a natural elevational gradient in Peru. During free hovering flight, hummingbirds showed increased stroke amplitude interspecifically at higher elevations, mirroring the intra-individual responses in our first laboratory experiment. During loaded flight, hummingbirds increased both wingbeat frequency and wing stroke amplitude by 19{\%} relative to free-flight values at any given elevation. We conclude that modulation of wing stroke amplitude is a major compensatory mechanism for flight in hypodense or hypobaric environments. By contrast, increases in wingbeat frequency impose substantial metabolic demands, are only elicited transiently and anaerobically, and cannot be used to generate additional sustained lift at high elevations.},

Here, previous work in the field of flapping wing control is summarized and each proposed technique is evaluated according to how many body forces and moments it can directly influence on the micro air vehicle and how complicated a wing flapping mechanism is needed to implement it. Though some promising techniques have been proposed, none satisfactorily address all of the design criteria; therefore, a new technique is proposed, biharmonic amplitude and bias modulation. This technique is analyzed with quasi-steady blade-element techniques and shown to provide direct influence over five micro air vehicle body forces and moments in hover while requiring only two actuators. Furthermore, it is applicable to a wing flapping mechanism operating at its resonant frequency, which 
reduces the energetic cost of control for the micro air vehicle.},

  abstract     = {The implications of spanwise flexibility on flapping wing aerodynamics are investigated numerically for a rectangular wing in pure heave. A computational framework for fluid-structural interactions has been developed based on a direct coupling procedure between (i) a pressure-based finite-volume fluid flow solver based on the Navier-Stokes equations, and (ii) a quasi-3D finite element structural dynamics solver based on a geometrically nonlinear composite beam-like and linear plate-like formulations. The computational results are first correlated with available experimental data. It is shown that two key factors associated with spanwise wing deformation affect thrust generation, namely, in-phase motion between the wing tip and root, and the increased effective angle of attack of the deformed wing. If the wing motions resulting from both prescribed motion and deformation are correlated, the increased effective angle of attack at the tip could enhance the aerodynamic performance. If the flexibility is too high, then the wing tip and root could move in inconsistent directions, resulting in deteriorated aerodynamic performance.},

abstract = {We present the first integrative computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of near- and far-field aerodynamics in insect hovering flight using a biology-inspired, dynamic flight simulator. This simulator, which has been built to encompass multiple mechanisms and principles related to insect flight, is capable of 'flying' an insect on the basis of realistic wing-body morphologies and kinematics. Our CFD study integrates near- and far-field wake dynamics and shows the detailed three-dimensional (3D) near- and far-field vortex flows: a horseshoe-shaped vortex is generated and wraps around the wing in the early down- and upstroke; subsequently, the horseshoe-shaped vortex grows into a doughnut-shaped vortex ring, with an intense jet-stream present in its core, forming the downwash; and eventually, the doughnut-shaped vortex rings of the wing pair break up into two circular vortex rings in the wake. The computed aerodynamic forces show reasonable agreement with experimental results in terms of both the mean force (vertical, horizontal and sideslip forces) and the time course over one stroke cycle (lift and drag forces). A large amount of lift force (approximately 62{\%} of total lift force generated over a full wingbeat cycle) is generated during the upstroke, most likely due to the presence of intensive and stable, leading-edge vortices (LEVs) and wing tip vortices (TVs); and correspondingly, a much stronger downwash is observed compared to the downstroke. We also estimated hovering energetics based on the computed aerodynamic and inertial torques, and powers.},

abstract = {Many interesting problems in reinforcement learning (RL) are continuous and/or high dimensional, and in this instance, RL techniques require the use of function approximators for learning value functions and policies. Often, local linear models have been preferred over distributed nonlinear models for function approximation in RL. We suggest that one reason for the difficulties encountered when using distributed architectures in RL is the problem of negative interference, whereby learning of new data disrupts previously learned mappings. The continuous temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm {\&}lambda; was used to learn a value function in a limited-torque pendulum swing-up task using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) network. Three different approaches were examined for learning in the MLP networks; 1) simple gradient descent; 2) vario-eta; and 3) a pseudopattern rehearsal strategy that attempts to reduce the effects of interference. Our results show that MLP networks can be used for value 
function approximation in this task but require long training times. We also found that vario-eta destabilized learning and resulted in a failure of the learning process to converge. Finally, we showed that the pseudopattern rehearsal strategy drastically improved the speed of learning. The results indicate that interference is a greater problem than ill conditioning for this task. {\&}copy; 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Gliding is an efficient form of travel found in every major group of terrestrial vertebrates. Gliding is often modelled in equilibrium, where aerodynamic forces exactly balance body weight resulting in constant velocity. Although the equilibrium model is relevant for long-distance gliding, such as soaring by birds, it may not be realistic for shorter distances between trees. To understand the aerodynamics of inter-tree gliding, we used direct observation and mathematical modelling. We used videography (60-125 fps) to track and reconstruct the three-dimensional trajectories of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) in nature. From their trajectories, we calculated velocities, aerodynamic forces and force coefficients. We determined that flying squirrels do not glide at equilibrium, and instead demonstrate continuously changing velocities, forces and force coefficients, and generate more lift than needed to balance body weight. We compared observed glide performance with mathematical simulations that use constant force coefficients, a characteristic of equilibrium glides. Simulations with varying force coefficients, such as those of live squirrels, demonstrated better whole-glide performance compared with the theoretical equilibrium state. Using results from both the observed glides and the simulation, we describe the mechanics and execution of inter-tree glides, and then discuss how gliding behaviour may relate to the evolution of flapping flight.},

abstract = {An experimental study of two-dimensional pitching and plunging airfoils at low Reynolds number (Re ) is presented. The main goals of the study are to provide a better understanding of flapping wing aerodynamics for application to the design of micro air vehicles (MAV) and to obtain detailed experimental data for validation of computational models. The effects of Re (range O(103 ) to (104 )) and airfoil shape (SD7003 and flat plate) are investigated for two kinematics consisting of sinusoidal effective angle of attack profiles: a shallow stall kinematics ({\&}alpha;eff (t ) range 2.4{\&}deg; to 13.6{\&}deg;), and a deep stall kinematics ({\&}alpha;eff (t ) range -6{\&}deg; to 22{\&}deg;). Re effects are observed only for the SD7003 airfoil and shallow stall kinematics at low Re , where laminar-to-turbulent transition was observed in the separated flow region during the down stroke motion that produced 20{\%} more lift coefficient compared to high Re cases. At high Re , the flow remains attached and the measured lift coefficient is in good agreement with unsteady linear theory. For the flat plate airfoil, a sharp leading edge produces boundary layer separation which forms a closed separation region for shallow stall kinematics or a leading edge vortex (LEV) for the deep stall kinematics. These flow features result in {\&}sim;50{\%} higher lift coefficient compared to unsteady linear theory predictions, and clearly document the significance of LEV in lift generation. To elucidate the role of reduced frequency, k , and Strouhal number, St , on force generation and LEV dynamics, parametric studies were conducted for the deep stall kinematics at fixed Re . It is found that the flow topology is similar at all conditions with formation of a LEV. An increase in k delayed the formation of a LEV which in turn affected the vortex evolution and unsteady force generation. The LEV core trajectory in the frame of reference moving with the airfoil is found to be independent of k and St , and solely a function of the effective angle of attack profile. Increasing St increases peak values of the lift coefficient by altering pitching and plunging rates. Peak lift coefficient values exceeding 4 are measured for St = 0.32.},

abstract = {A new algorithm for reinforcement learning, advantage updating, is described. Advantage updating is a direct learning technique; it does not require a model to be given or learned. It is incremental, requiring only a constant amount of calculation per time step, independent of the number of possible actions, possible outcomes from a given action, or number of states. Analysis and simulation indicate that advantage updating is applicable to reinforcement learning systems working in continuous time (or discrete time with small time steps) for which standard algorithms such as Q-learning are not applicable. Simulation results are presented indicating that for a simple linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem, advantage updating learns more quickly than Q-learning by a factor of 100,000 when the time step is small. Even for large time steps, advantage updating is never slower than Q-learning, and advantage updating is more resistant to noise than is Q-learning. Convergence properties are discussed. 
It is proved that the learning rule for advantage updating converges to the optimal policy with probability one},

The property of self-similarity simplifies substantially the mathematical modeling of phenomena and its analysis--experimental, analytical and computational. The book begins from a non-traditional exposition of dimensional analysis, physical similarity theory and general theory of scaling phenomena. Classical examples of scaling phenomena are presented. It is demonstrated that scaling comes on a stage when the influence of fine details of initial and/or boundary conditions disappeared but the system is still far from ultimate equilibrium state (intermediate asymptotics). It is explained why the dimensional analysis as a rule is insufficient for establishing self-similarity and constructing scaling variables. Important examples of scaling phenomena for which the dimensional analysis is insufficient (self-similarities of the second kind) are presented and discussed. A close connection of intermediate asymptotics and self-similarities of the second kind with a fundamental concept of theoretical physics, the renormalization group, is explained and discussed. Numerous examples from various fields--from theoretical biology to fracture mechanics, turbulence, flame propagation, flow in porous strata, atmospheric and oceanic phenomena are presented for which the ideas of scaling, intermediate asymptotics, self-similarity and renormalization group were of decisive value in modeling.},

abstract = {Recent flow visualisation experiments with the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, revealed small but clear leading-edge vortex and a pronounced three-dimensional flow. Details of this flow pattern were studied with a scaled-up, robotic insect ('the flapper') that accurately mimicked the wing movements of a hovering hawkmoth. Smoke released from the leading edge of the flapper wing confirmed the existence of a small, strong and stable leading-edge vortex, increasing in size from wingbase to wingtip. Between 25 and 75 per cent of the wing length, its diameter increased approximately from 10 to 50 per cent of the wing chord. The leading-edge vortex had a strong axial flow veolocity, which stabilized it and reduced its diamater. The vortex separated from the wing at approximately 75 per cent of the wing length and thus fed vorticity into a large, tangled tip vortex. If the circulation of the leading-edge vortex were fully used for lift generation, it could support up to two-thirds of the hawkmoth's weight during the downstroke. The growth of this circulation with time and spanwise position clearly identify dynamic stall as the unsteady aerodynamic mechanism responsible for high lift production by hovering hawkmoths and possibly also by many other insect species.},

Here, we introduce a method for mapping an animal's actions, relying only upon the underlying structure of postural movement data to organize and classify behaviours. Applying this method to the ground-based behaviour of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, we find that flies perform stereotyped actions roughly 50{\%} of the time, discovering over 100 distinguishable, stereotyped behavioural states. These include multiple modes of locomotion and grooming. We use the resulting measurements as the basis for identifying subtle sex-specific behavioural differences and revealing the low-dimensional nature of animal motions.},

This paper uses the recently developed sliding mode control driven by sliding mode disturbance observer (SMC-SMDO) approach to design a robust flight controller for a small quadrotor vehicle. This technique allows for a continuous control robust to external disturbance and model uncertainties to be computed without the use of high control gain or extensive computational power. The robustness of the control to unknown external disturbances also leads to a reduction of the design cost as less pre-flight analyses are required. The multiple-loop, multiple time-scale SMC-SMDO flight controller is designed to provide robust position and attitude control of the vehicle while relying only on knowledge of the limits of the disturbances. Extensive simulations of a 6 DOF computer model demonstrate the robustness of the control when faced with external disturbances (including wind, collision and actuator failure) as well as model uncertainties. .?? 2011 The Franklin Institute.

The proposed AC-based controller consists of two neural networks (NNs) - an action NN, also called the actor, which approximates the plant dynamics and generates appropriate control actions; and a critic NN, which evaluates the performance of the actor based on some performance index. The reinforcement signal from the critic is used to develop a composite weight tuning law for the action NN based on Lyapunov stability analysis.

abstract = {The flow structure that is largely responsible for the good performance of insect wings has recently been identified as a leading-edge vortex. But because such vortices become detached from a wing in two-dimensional flow, an unknown mechanism must keep them attached to (three-dimensional) flapping wings. The current explanation, analogous to a mechanism operating on delta-wing aircraft, is that spanwise flow through a spiral vortex drains energy from the vortex core. We have tested this hypothesis by systematically mapping the flow generated by a dynamically scaled model insect while simultaneously measuring the resulting aerodynamic forces. Here we report that, at the Reynolds numbers matching the flows relevant for most insects, flapping wings do not generate a spiral vortex akin to that produced by delta-wing aircraft. We also find that limiting spanwise flow with fences and edge baffles does not cause detachment of the leading-edge vortex. The data support an alternative hypothesis-that downward flow induced by tip vortices limits the growth of the leading-edge vortex.},

abstract = {We used two-dimensional digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) to visualize flow patterns around the flapping wing of a dynamically scaled robot for a series of reciprocating strokes starting from rest. The base of the wing was equipped with strain gauges so that the pattern of fluid motion could be directly compared with the time history of force production. The results show that the development and shedding of vortices throughout each stroke are highly stereotyped and influence force generation in subsequent strokes. When a wing starts from rest, it generates a transient force as the leading edge vortex (LEV) grows. This early peak, previously attributed to added-mass acceleration, is not amenable to quasi-steady models but corresponds well to calculations based on the time derivative of the first moment of vorticity within a sectional slice of fluid. Forces decay to a stable level as the LEV reaches a constant size and remains attached throughout most of the stroke. The LEV grows as the wing supinates prior to stroke reversal, accompanied by an increase in total force. At stroke reversal, both the LEV and a rotational starting vortex (RSV) are shed into the wake, forming a counter-rotating pair that directs a jet of fluid towards the underside of the wing at the start of the next stroke. We isolated the aerodynamic influence of the wake by subtracting forces and flow fields generated in the first stroke, when the wake is just developing, from those produced during the fourth stroke, when the pattern of both the forces and wake dynamics has reached a limit cycle. This technique identified two effects of the wake on force production by the wing: an early augmentation followed by a small attenuation. The later decrease in force is consistent with the influence of a decreased aerodynamic angle of attack on translational forces caused by downwash within the wake and is well explained by a quasi-steady model. The early effect of the wake is not well approximated by a quasi-steady model, even when the magnitude and orientation of the instantaneous velocity field are taken into account. Thus, the wake capture force represents a truly unsteady phenomenon dependent on temporal changes in the distribution and magnitude of vorticity during stroke reversal.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present an approach to employ evolvable hardware concepts, to effectively construct flapping-wing mechanism controllers for micro robots, with the evolved dynamically complex controllers embedded in a, physically realizable, micro-scale reconfigurable substrate. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, a continuous time recurrent neural network (CTRNN)-evolvable hardware (a neuromorphic variant of evolvable hardware) framework and methodologies are employed in the process of designing the evolution experiments. CTRNN is selected as the neuromorphic reconfigurable substrate with most efficient Minipop Evolutionary Algorithm, configured to drive the evolution process. The uniqueness of the reconfigurable CTRNN substrate preferred for this study is perceived from its universal dynamics approximation capabilities and prospective to realize the same in small area and low power chips, the properties which are very much a basic requirement for flapping-wing 
based micro robot control. A simulated micro mechanical flapping insect model is employed to conduct the feasibility study of evolving neuromorphic controllers using the above-mentioned methodology. Findings: It has been demonstrated that the presented neuromorphic evolvable hardware approach can be effectively used to evolve controllers, to produce various flight dynamics like cruising, steering, and altitude gain in a simulated micro mechanical insect. Moreover, an appropriate feasibility is presented, to realize the evolved controllers in small area and lower power chips, with available fabrication techniques and as well as utilizing the complex dynamics nature of CTRNNs to encompass various controls ability in a architecturally static hardware circuit, which are more pertinent to meet the constraints of micro robot construction and control. Originality/value: The proposed neuromorphic evolvable hardware approach along with its modules intact (CTRNNs and Minipop) can provide a general mechanism to 
construct/evolve dynamically complex and optimal controllers for flapping-wing mechanism based micro robots for various environments with least human intervention. Further, the evolved neuromorphic controllers in simulation study can be successfully transferred to its hardware counterpart without sacrificing its anticipated functionality and realized within a predictable area and power ranges. {\&}copy; Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract = {Presented is the application of Kane's Equations to derive the equations-of-motion for flapping wing micro air vehicles that are comprised of several articulated rigid bodies. The motivation for this work is to develop a generalized approach to be able to simulate flight dynamics of micro air vehicle systems that have varying mechanical complexity. The approach laid out here will also aid our understanding of the biomechanics of birds and insects while in flight in order to better provide insight into their flight dynamics. For this paper, we will limit the development of the equations-of-motion to two specific cases: micro air vehicles whose bodies are comprised of simply connected, rigid body segments and whose wings are 1) considered massless as compared to the main body and 2) have appreciable mass when compared to the main body. In the second case, we only consider the case where each wing consists of a single rigid body, assumed to be a plate of negligible thickness, attached to the 
fuselage. However, the approach outlined in this paper is generic enough to consider wings that have multiple joints along the span, which is of interest for studying more complex vehicle configurations. We compare the open-loop dynamics of a micro air vehicle under the assumptions above, and show that despite the fact that the wings make up a very small percentage of the total vehicle mass, their inertial effects are of the same order of magnitude as the aerodynamic forces.},

abstract = {Actuator disc models of insect flight are concerned solely with the rate of momentum transfer to the air that passes through the disc. These simple models assume that an even pressure is applied across the disc, resulting in a uniform downwash distribution. However, a correction factor, k, is often included to correct for the difference in efficiency between the assumed even downwash distribution, and the real downwash distribution. In the absence of any empirical measurements of the downwash distribution behind a real insect, the values of k used in the literature have been necessarily speculative. Direct measurement of this efficiency factor is now possible, and could be used to compare the relative efficiencies of insect flight across the Class. Here, we use Digital Particle Image Velocimetry to measure the instantaneous downwash distribution, mid-downstroke, of a tethered desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria). By integrating the downwash distribution, we are thereby able to provide the first direct empirical measurement of k for an insect. The measured value of k = 1.12 corresponds reasonably well with that predicted by previous theoretical studies.},

Sotiropoulos, A Numerical Method for Solving the 3D Unsteady Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations in Curvilinear Domains with Complex Immersed Boundaries, Journal of Computational Physics 225 (2007) 1782-1809] is extended to simulate fluid structure interaction (FSI) problems involving complex 3D rigid bodies undergoing large structural displacements. The FSI solver adopts the partitioned FSI solution approach and both loose and strong coupling strategies are implemented. The interfaces between immersed bodies and the fluid are discretized with a Lagrangian grid and tracked with an explicit front-tracking approach. An efficient ray-tracing algorithm is developed to quickly identify the relationship between the background grid and the moving bodies. Numerical experiments are carried out for two FSI problems: vortex induced vibration of elastically mounted cylinders and flow through a bileaflet mechanical heart valve at physiologic conditions. For both cases the computed results are in excellent agreement with benchmark simulations and experimental measurements. The numerical experiments suggest that both the properties of the structure (mass, geometry) and the local flow conditions can play an important role in determining the stability of the FSI algorithm. Under certain conditions unconditionally unstable iteration schemes result even when strong coupling FSI is employed. For such cases, however, combining the strong-coupling iteration with under-relaxation in conjunction with the Aitken's acceleration technique is shown to effectively resolve the stability problems. A theoretical analysis is presented to explain the findings of the numerical experiments. It is shown that the ratio of the added mass to the mass of the structure as well as the sign of the local time rate of change of the force or moment imparted on the structure by the fluid determine the stability and convergence of the FSI algorithm. The stabilizing role of under-relaxation is also clarified and an upper bound of the required for stability under-relaxation coefficient is derived.},

abstract = {We employ numerical simulation to investigate the hydrodynamics of carangiform locomotion as the relative magnitude of viscous and inertial forces, i.e. the Reynolds number (Re), and the tail-beat frequency, i.e. the Strouhal number (St), are systematically varied. The model fish is a three-dimensional (3D) mackerel-like flexible body undulating with prescribed experimental kinematics of carangiform type. Simulations are carried out for three Re spanning the transitional and inertial flow regimes, Re=300 and 4000 (viscous flow), and infinity (inviscid flow). For each Re there is a critical Strouhal number, St*, at which the net mean force becomes zero, making constant-speed self-propulsion possible. St* is a decreasing function of Re and approaches the range of St at which most carangiform swimmers swim in nature (St approximately 0.25) only as Re approaches infinity. The propulsive efficiency at St* is an increasing function of Re while the power required for swimming is decreasing with Re. For all Re, however, the swimming power is shown to be significantly greater than that required to tow the rigid body at the same speed. We also show that the variation of the total drag and its viscous and form components with St depend on the Re. For Re=300, body undulations increase the drag over the rigid body level, while significant drag reduction is observed for Re=4000. This difference is shown to be due to the fact that at sufficiently high Re the drag force variation with St is dominated by its form component variation, which is reduced by undulatory swimming for St{\textgreater}0.2. Finally, our simulations clarify the 3D structure of various wake patterns observed in experiments--single and double row vortices--and suggest that the wake structure depends primarily on the St. Our numerical findings help elucidate the results of previous experiments with live fish, underscore the importance of scale (Re) effects on the hydrodynamic performance of carangiform swimming, and help explain why in nature this mode of swimming is typically preferred by fast swimmers.},

abstract = {Billions of animals migrate each year. To successfully reach their destination, migrants must have evolved an appropriate genetic program and suitable developmental, morphological, physiological, biomechanical, behavioral, and life-history traits. Moreover, they must interact successfully with biotic and abiotic factors in their environment. Migration therefore provides an excellent model system in which to address several of the grand challenges in organismal biology. Previous research on migration, however, has often focused on a single aspect of the phenomenon, largely due to methodological, geographical, or financial constraints. Integrative migration biology asks 'big questions' such as how, when, where, and why animals migrate, which can be answered by examining the process from multiple ecological and evolutionary perspectives, incorporating multifaceted knowledge from various other scientific disciplines, and using new technologies and modeling approaches, all within the context of an annual cycle. Adopting an integrative research strategy will provide a better understanding of the interactions between biological levels of organization, of what role migrants play in disease transmission, and of how to conserve migrants and the habitats upon which they depend.},

abstract = {Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are parasitized by the protozoan Ophryocystis elektroscirrha throughout their geographical range. Monarchs inhabiting seasonally fluctuating environments migrate annually, and parasite prevalence is lower among migratory relative to non-migratory populations. One explanation for this pattern is that long-distance migration weeds out infected animals, thus reducing parasite prevalence and transmission between generations. In this study we experimentally infected monarchs from a migratory population and recorded their long-distance flight performance using a tethered flight mill. Results showed that parasitized butterflies exhibited shorter flight distances, slower flight speeds, and lost proportionately more body mass per km flown. Differences between parasitized and unparasitized monarchs were generally not explained by individual variation in wing size, shape, or wing loading, suggesting that poorer flight performance among parasitized hosts was not directly caused by morphological constraints. Effects of parasite infection on powered flight support a role for long-distance migration in dramatically reducing parasite prevalence in this and other host–pathogen systems.},

abstract = {From late August to early September, millions of adult monarch butterflies of the eastern North American population cease reproducing, become highly gregarious and begin migrating southwards. By mid-October, they migrate through central Texas into Mexico where they follow the Sierra Madre Oriental across the Tropic of Cancer. They then shift direction westwards towards the Transverse Neovolcanic Belt of mountains where they overwinter without breeding. A rapid exodus northwards occurs at the spring equinox, and by early April both sexes reach the Gulf Coast states where the females lay eggs on the resurgent spring milkweed (Asclepias) flora and die. Adults of the new generation continue the migration to the northernmost breeding range, arriving by early June. Two or more short-lived breeding generations are produced over the summer, spread eastwards across the Appalachian Mountains and, by September, the autumn migration is again under way. This paper presents a new hypothesis that the orientation of adult monarchs undergoes a continual clockwise shifting throughout the 3-5 generations, rotating by 360 in the course of the year. This hypothesis is consistent with the timing of arrivals and the relative abundances of the successive generations of monarchs throughout eastern North America, with the directions of movement of their spring, summer and autumn generations, and with the timing of their arrival at the overwintering area in central Mexico.},

abstract = {Monarch butterflies in eastern North America accumulate lipids during their fall migration to central Mexico, and use them as their energy source during a 5 month overwintering period. When and where along their migratory journey the butterflies accumulate these lipids has implications for the importance of fall nectar sources in North America. We analyzed the lipid content of 765 summer breeding and fall migrant monarch butterflies collected at 1 nectaring site in central Virginia over 4 years (1998-2001), and compared them with 16 additional published and unpublished datasets from other sites, dating back to 1941. Virginia migrants store significantly more lipid than summer butterflies, and show significant intraseason and between-year variation. None of the Virginia samples, and none of the historical samples, with one exception, had lipid levels comparable with those found in migrants that had reached Texas and northern Mexico. This evidence suggests that upon reaching Texas, the butterflies undergo a behavioral shift and spend more time nectaring. The one exceptional sample led us to the discovery that monarchs that form roosts along their migratory routes have higher lipid contents than monarchs collected while nectaring at flowers. We propose that for much of their journey monarchs are opportunistic migrants, and the variation within and between samples reflects butterflies' individual experiences. The stored lipids appear to be of less importance as fuel for the butterflies' migration than for their survival during their overwintering period, in part because soaring on favorable winds reduces the energetic cost of flying. The conservation of nectar plants in Texas and northern Mexico is crucial to sustaining the monarch's migratory spectacle, and nectar abundance throughout eastern North America is also important. As generalists in their selection of nectar sources and nectaring habitats, monarchs are unlikely to be affected by small changes in plant communities. Agricultural transformations of natural communities in the eastern United States and Great Plains, however, and especially the extensive planting of genetically modified herbicide-resistant soybeans and corn, may be changing the availability of nectar for monarchs and other pollinators. This new technology is eliminating virtually all forbs in and surrounding agricultural fields, including the monarch's larval hostplants (milkweeds) and native and nonnative nectar sources. To evaluate whether changes in nectar availability are altering the butterflies' ability to accumulate energy, we recommend that monarchs' lipid contents be assayed annually at sites throughout eastern North America.},

No initial model for the nonlinear system is necessary. The work shows how to cope with nonlinearities through adaptive critics with no preliminary off-line learning required. The proposed scheme consists of a feedforward action generating NN that compensates for the unknown system nonlinearities. The learning of this NN is performed online based on a signal from a second neural network acting as a critic. The critic NN tunes itself online using the performance measure of the system. Both NN tuning algorithms are based on backpropagation, which must be modified to guarantee closed-loop performance. The two algorithms are derived using nonlinear stability analysis, so that both system tracking stability and error convergence can be guaranteed in the closed-loop system},

abstract = {Without sensory feedback, flies cannot fly. Exactly how various feedback controls work in insects is a complex puzzle to solve. What do insects measure to stabilize their flight? How often and how fast must insects adjust their wings to remain stable? To gain insights into algorithms used by insects to control their dynamic instability, we develop a simulation tool to study free flight. To stabilize flight, we construct a control algorithm that modulates wing motion based on discrete measurements of the body-pitch orientation. Our simulations give theoretical bounds on both the sensing rate and the delay time between sensing and actuation. Interpreting our findings together with experimental results on fruit flies' reaction time and sensory motor reflexes, we conjecture that fruit flies sense their kinematic states every wing beat to stabilize their flight. We further propose a candidate for such a control involving the fly's haltere and first basalar motor neuron. Although we focus on fruit flies as a case study, the framework for our simulation and discrete control algorithms is applicable to studies of both natural and man-made fliers.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed analysis of the take-off mechanics in droneflies performing voluntary take-offs. Wing and body kinematics of the insects during take-off were measured using high-speed video techniques. Based on the measured data, the inertia force acting on the insect was computed and the aerodynamic force of the wings was calculated by the method of computational fluid dynamics. Subtracting the aerodynamic force and the weight from the inertia force gave the leg force. In take-off, a dronefly increases its stroke amplitude gradually in the first 10-14 wingbeats and becomes airborne at about the 12th wingbeat. The aerodynamic force increases monotonously from zero to a value a little larger than its weight, and the leg force decreases monotonously from a value equal to its weight to zero, showing that the droneflies do not jump and only use aerodynamic force of flapping wings to lift themselves into the air. Compared with take-offs in insects in previous studies, in which a very large force (5-10 times of the weight) generated either by jumping legs (locusts, milkweed bugs and fruit flies) or by the 'fling' mechanism of the wing pair (butterflies) is used in a short time, the take-off in the droneflies is relatively slow but smoother.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider the use of nonlinear networks towards obtaining nearly optimal solutions to the control of nonlinear discrete-time (DT) systems. The method is based on least squares successive approximation solution of the generalized Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (GHJB) equation which appears in optimization problems. Successive approximation using the GHJB has not been applied for nonlinear DT systems. The proposed recursive method solves the GHJB equation in DT on a well-defined region of attraction. The definition of GHJB, pre-Hamiltonian function, HJB equation, and method of updating the control function for the affine nonlinear DT systems under small perturbation assumption are proposed. A neural network (NN) is used to approximate the GHJB solution. It is shown that the result is a closed-loop control based on an NN that has been tuned a priori in offline mode. Numerical examples show that, for the linear DT system, the updated control laws will converge to the optimal control, and 
for nonlinear DT systems, the updated control laws will converge to the suboptimal control.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a neural adaptive controller for attitude control in a flapping-wing insect model. The model is nonlinear and subjected to periodic force/torque generated by nominal wing kinematics. Two sets of model parameters are obtained from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the honey bee Apis mellifera. Attitude control is achieved by modifying the wing kinematics on a stroke-by-stroke basis. The controller is based on filtered-error with neural network models approximating system nonlinearities. Lyapunov-based stability analysis shows the asymptotic convergence of system outputs. We present simulation results for angular position stabilization and trajectory tracking. Trajectory tracking is illustrated by two cases: saccadic turning and sinusoidal variation in the yaw angle. The proposed controller successfully regulates flight orientation - roll, pitch and yaw angles - by generating desired torque resulting from tuning parameterized wing motion. Results furthermore show 
similarities between simulated and observed turning from real insects, suggesting some inherent properties in insect flight dynamics and control. The proposed controller has potential applications in future flapping-wing Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs).},

abstract = {During flapping flight, insect wings must withstand not only fluid-dynamic forces, but also inertial-elastic forces generated by the rapid acceleration and deceleration of their own mass. Estimates of overall aerodynamic and inertial forces vary widely, and the relative importance of these forces in determining passive wing deformations remains unknown. If aeroelastic interactions between a wing and the fluid-dynamic forces it generates are minor compared to the effects of wing inertia, models of insect flight that account for passive wing flexibility would be far simpler to develop. We used an experimental approach to examine the contributions of aerodynamic and inertial-elastic forces to wing bending in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. We attached fresh Manduca wings to a motor and flapped them at a realistic wing-beat frequency and stroke amplitude. We compared wing bending in normal air versus helium (approx. 15{\%} air density), in which the contribution of fluid-dynamic forces to wing deformations is significantly reduced. This 85{\%} reduction in air density produced only slight changes in the pattern of Manduca wing deformations, suggesting that fluid-dynamic forces have a minimal effect on wing bending. We used a simplified finite element model of a wing to show that the differences observed between wings flapped in air versus helium are most likely due to fluid damping, rather than to aerodynamic forces. This suggests that damped finite element models of insect wings (with no fluid-dynamic forces included) may be able to predict overall patterns of wing deformation prior to calculations of aerodynamic force production, facilitating integrative models of insect flight.},

abstract = {The dynamic, three-dimensional shape of flapping insect wings may influence many aspects of flight performance. Insect wing deformations during flight are largely passive, and are controlled primarily by the architecture and material properties of the wing. Although many details of wing structure are well understood, the distribution of flexural stiffness in insect wings and its effects on wing bending are unknown. In this study, we developed a method of estimating spatial variation in flexural stiffness in both the spanwise and chordwise direction of insect wings. We measured displacement along the wing in response to a point force, and modeled flexural stiffness variation as a simple mathematical function capable of approximating this measured displacement. We used this method to estimate flexural stiffness variation in the hawkmoth Manduca sexta, and the dragonfly Aeshna multicolor. In both species, flexural stiffness declines sharply from the wing base to the tip, and from the leading edge to the trailing edge; this variation can be approximated by an exponential decline. The wings of M. sexta also display dorsal/ventral asymmetry in flexural stiffness and significant differences between males and females. Finite element models based on M. sexta forewings demonstrate that the measured spatial variation in flexural stiffness preserves rigidity in proximal regions of the wing, while transferring bending to the edges, where aerodynamic force production is most sensitive to subtle changes in shape.},

abstract = {Environmental turbulence is ubiquitous in natural habitats, but its effect on flying animals remains unknown because most flight studies are performed in still air or artificially smooth flow. Here we show that variability in external airflow limits maximum flight speed in wild orchid bees by causing severe instabilities. Bees flying in front of an outdoor, turbulent air jet become increasingly unstable about their roll axis as airspeed and flow variability increase. Bees extend their hindlegs ventrally at higher speeds, improving roll stability but also increasing body drag and associated power requirements by 30{\%}. Despite the energetic cost, we observed this stability-enhancing behavior in 10 euglossine species from 3 different genera, spanning an order of magnitude in body size. A field experiment in which we altered the level of turbulence demonstrates that flight instability and maximum flight speed are directly related to flow variability. The effect of environmental turbulence on flight stability is thus an important and previously unrecognized determinant of flight performance.},

abstract = {The morphology, kinematics and stiffness properties of lifting surfaces play a key role in the aerodynamic performance of vertebrate flight. These surfaces, as a result of their flexible nature, may move both actively, owing to muscle contraction, and passively, in reaction to fluid forces. However, the nature and implications of this fluid-structure interaction are not well understood. Here, we study passive flight (flight with no active wing actuation) and explore a physical mechanism that leads to the emergence of a natural flapping motion. We model a vertebrate wing with a compliant shoulder and the ability to camber with an idealized physical model consisting of a cantilevered flat plate with a hinged trailing flap. We find that at low wind speed the wing is stationary, but at a critical speed the wing spontaneously flaps. The lift coefficient is significantly enhanced once the wing starts to oscillate, although this increase in lift generation is accompanied by an increase in drag. Flow visualization suggests that a strong leading edge vortex attached to the wing during downstroke is the primary mechanism responsible for the enhanced lift. The flapping instability we observe suggests a possible scenario for an evolutionary transition from gliding to powered flapping flight in animals that possess compliant wings capable of passive camber. Although the flapping state is accompanied by a lower lift-to-drag ratio, the increased lifting capability it confers might have enabled increased body mass, improved foraging performance and/or flight at lower speeds, any of which might have been selectively advantageous.},

A small system of equations, only involving the boundary nodes, has to be solved and no grid-connectivity information is needed. The method can handle large mesh deformations caused by translations, rotations and deformations, both for 2D and 3D meshes. However, the performance depends on the used RBF. The best accuracy and robustness with the highest efficiency are obtained with a C2 continuous RBF with compact support, closely followed by the thin plate spline. The deformed meshes are suitable for flow computations as is shown by performing calculations around a NACA-0012 airfoil.},

abstract = {A stationary organism exposed to steady turbulent flow is subjected to a drag force that fluctuates about a mean, and when the drag on the organism is characterized, it is traditionally this mean force that is cited. Important information is lost, however, when the fluctuations in drag are ignored. This is particularly true when extreme drag forces are relevant; for instance, when predicting the survival of benthic animals on wave-swept shores and in torrential streams, or of plants in windblown terrestrial habitats. This study reports on the probability distribution of drag fluctuations for five objects: a flat plate, large and small cylinders, a sphere and a limpet shell. Distributions vary substantially among different objects exposed to the same mainstream flow; the sphere and limpet exhibit larger fluctuations than the plate and cylinders. The distribution of extremes in drag is used to predict the likelihood that an organism will be dislodged. For organisms in which the applied fluid-dynamic stress is near the mean breaking stress (e.g. some corals, trees and mussels), calculations made using the extreme drag can yield a probability of dislodgment substantially higher than that calculated using the average.},

abstract = {1. Flight is a key innovation in the evolution of insects that is crucial to their dispersal, migration, territoriality, courtship and predator avoidance. Male butterflies have characteristic territoriality and courtship flight behaviours, and females use a characteristic flight behaviour when searching for host plants. This implies that selection acts on wing morphology to maximize flight performance for conducting important behaviours among sexes. 2. Butterflies in the genus Morpho are obvious components of neotropical forests, and many observations indicate that they show two broad categories of flight behaviour and flight height. Although species can be categorized as using gliding or flapping flight, and flying at either canopy or understorey height, the association of flight behaviour and flight height with wing shape evolution has never been explored. 3. Two clades within Morpho differ in flight behaviour and height. Males and females of one clade inhabit the forest understorey and use flapping flight, whereas in the other clade, males use gliding flight at canopy level and females use flapping flight in both canopy and understorey. 4. We used independent contrasts to answer whether wing shape is associated with flight behaviour and height. Given a single switch to canopy habitation and gliding flight, we compared contrasts for the node at which the switch to canopy flight occurred with the distribution of values in the two focal clades. We found significant changes in wing shape at the transition to canopy flight only in males, and no change in size for either sex. A second node within the canopy clade suggests that other factors may also be involved in wing shape evolution. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that natural selection acts differently on male and female butterfly wing shape and indicate that the transition to canopy flight cannot explain all wing shape diversity in Morpho. 5. This study provides a starting point for characterizing evolution of wing morphology in forest butterflies in the contexts of habitat selection and flight behaviour. Further, these observations suggest that exploring wing shape evolution for canopy and understorey species in other insects may help understand the effects of habitat destruction on biological diversity.},

abstract = {We compare computational, experimental and quasi-steady forces in a generic hovering wing undergoing sinusoidal motion along a horizontal stroke plane. In particular, we investigate unsteady effects and compare two-dimensional (2D) computations and three-dimensional (3D) experiments in several qualitatively different kinematic patterns. In all cases, the computed drag compares well with the experiments. The computed lift agrees in the cases in which the sinusoidal changes in angle of attack are symmetrical or advanced with respect to stroke positions, but lags behind the measured 3D lift in the delayed case. In the range of amplitudes studied here, 3-5 chords, the force coefficients have a weak dependence on stroke amplitude. As expected, the forces are sensitive to the phase between stroke angle and angle of attack, a result that can be explained by the orientation of the wing at reversal. This dependence on amplitude and phase suggests a simple maneuver strategy that could be used by a flapping wing device. In all cases the unsteady forces quickly reach an almost periodic state with continuous flapping. The fluid forces are dominated by the pressure contribution. The force component directly proportional to the linear acceleration is smaller by a factor proportional to the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; its net contribution is zero in hovering. The ratio of wing inertia and fluid force is proportional to the product of the ratio of wing and fluid density and the ratio of wing thickness and stroke amplitude; it is negligible in the robotic wing experiment, but need not be in insect flight. To identify unsteady effects associated with wing acceleration, and coupling between rotation and translation, as well as wake capture, we examine the difference between the unsteady forces and the estimates based on translational velocities, and compare them against the estimate of the coupling between rotation and translation, which have simple analytic forms for sinusoidal motions. The agreement and disagreement between the computed forces and experiments offer further insight into when the 3D effects are important. A main difference between a 3D revolving wing and a 2D translating wing is the absence of vortex shedding by a revolving wing over a distance much longer than the typical stroke length of insects. No doubt such a difference in shedding dynamics is responsible in part for the differences in steady state force coefficients measured in 2D and 3D. On the other hand, it is unclear whether such differences would have a significant effect on transient force coefficients before the onset of shedding. While the 2D steady state force coefficients underpredict 3D forces, the transient 2D forces measured prior to shedding are much closer to the 3D forces. In the cases studied here, the chord is moving between 3 to 5 chords, typical of hovering insect stroke length, and the flow does not appear to separate during each stroke in the cases of advanced and symmetrical rotation. In these cases, the wing reverses before the leading edge vortex would have time to separate even in 2D. This suggests that the time scale for flow separation in these strokes is dictated by the flapping frequency, which is dimensionally independent. In such cases, the 2D unsteady forces turn out to be good approximations of 3D experiments.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the temporal control of a fast wing rotation in flies, the ventral flip, which occurs during the transition from downstroke to upstroke. Tethered flying Drosophila actively modulate the timing of these rapid supinations during yaw responses evoked by an oscillating visual stimulus. The time difference between the two wings is controlled such that the wing on the outside of a fictive turn rotates in advance of its contralateral partner. This modulation of ventral-flip timing between the two wings is strongly coupled with changes in wing-stroke amplitude. Typically, an increase in the stroke amplitude of one wing is correlated with an advance in the timing of the ventral flip of the same wing. However, flies do display a limited ability to control these two behaviors independently, as shown by flight records in which the correlation between ventral-flip timing and stroke amplitude transiently reverses. The control of ventral-flip timing may be part of an unsteady aerodynamic mechanism that enables the fly to alter the magnitude and direction of flight forces during turning maneuvers.},

abstract = {Animal flight at altitude involves substantial aerodynamic and physiological challenges. Hovering at high elevations is particularly demanding from the dual perspectives of lift and power output; nevertheless, some volant insects reside and fly at elevations in excess of 4000 m. Here, we demonstrate that alpine bumble-bees possess substantial aerodynamic reserves, and can sustain hovering flight under hypobaria at effective elevations in excess of 9000 m, i.e. higher than Mt. Everest. Modulation of stroke amplitude and not wingbeat frequency is the primary means of compensation for overcoming the aerodynamic challenge. The presence of such excess capacity in a high-altitude bumble-bee is surprising and suggests intermittent behavioural demands for extreme flight performance supplemental to routine foraging.},

abstract = {The ability of orchid bees to generate vertical forces was evaluated using
a load-lifting method that imposed asymptotically increasing loads during
ascending flight, ultimately eliciting maximum forces while hovering. Among 11
orchid bee species varying by approximately an order of magnitude in body
mass, the capacity to produce vertical forces expressed relative either to
body weight or to flight muscle weight declined linearly with increased body
mass. Allometric analysis of log-transformed data, by contrast, found maximum
vertical force to scale isometrically with body mass, but also to exhibit a
slightly negative allometry with respect to flight muscle mass. Maximum stroke
amplitude at limiting loads averaged 140° and was remarkably constant
among species, a result consistent with anatomical constraints of the
hymenopteran thorax on wing motions. By contrast, wing-beat frequencies during
maximum performance declined with increasing body mass. Repeated lifting by
individual bees reduced performance only when the number of consecutive lifts
exceeded 15. Variation in linear mass density of the lifted load did not
systematically alter performance estimates, although measurements on one
species in two consecutive years at different thermal environments yielded
significant differences in estimates of maximum force production. These
findings suggest an adverse scaling of vertical force production at greater
body mass even if flight muscle mass scales isometrically. },

abstract = {A quasi-steady aerodynamic analysis of forward flight was performed on 15 species of neotropical butterflies for which kinematic and morphological data were available. Mean lift coefficients required for flight typically exceeded maximum values obtained on insect wings under conditions of steady flow, thereby implicating unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms even during fast forward flight of some butterflies. The downstroke produced vertical forces on average 18{\%} in excess of those necessary to support the body weight through the wingbeat, while the upstroke contributed minimal or negative vertical force. Estimated effective angles of incidence (alphaT of the wings averaged 39degrees during the downstroke and -22degrees during the upstroke; spanwise variation in alphaT was greater than the average difference between half-strokes. Total mechanical power requirements of forward flight averaged 12.5 W kg-1, for the case of perfect elastic storage of whig inertial energy, and 20.2 W kg-1, assuming zero elastic energy storage. Energetic costs of the erratic trajectories during forward flight increased mechanical power requirements by an average of 43{\%}, assuming perfect elastic storage. Fluctuations in horizontal kinetic energy of the center of mass were principally responsible for this dramatic increase. When comparing different species, total mechanical power increased linearly with forward airspeed (assuming perfect elastic energy storage of inertial energy) and scaled with mass0.26 If no elastic energy storage was assumed, mechanical power was independent of airspeed and was proportional to mass0.36. Estimated metabolic rates during flight averaged 22 and 36 ml O2 g-1 h-1, for the cases of perfect and zero elastic storage, respectively.},

abstract = {Airspeed measurements during natural free flight were made on a total of 270 neotropical butterflies representing 62 species. Morphological data were obtained from the same individuals for which airspeeds had been determined. Flight speed was positively correlated with body mass, thoracic mass and wing loading. Controlling for body mass, higher wing loadings were correlated with increased flight speed. Flight speed and wing aspect ratio were negatively correlated. No consistent correlations were found between airspeed and wing length, wing area or body length. Released butterflies and butterflies encountered in natural free flight did not differ substantially in flight speed allometry. The observed scaling of flight speeds was similar to that derived for a much smaller sample of butterflies flying in an insectary, although absolute values of flight speed were approximately three times higher in natural flight and correlation coefficients of allometric regressions were typically lower. These results suggest that butterfly airspeeds under natural conditions can reasonably be predicted from morphological measurements, and that studying flight in enclosed spaces preserves the allometry of flight speeds.},

abstract = {Accelerations and directional changes of flying animals derive from interactions between aerodynamic force production and the inertial resistance of the body to translation and rotation. Anatomical and allometric features of body design thus mediate the rapidity of aerial maneuvers. Both translational and rotational responsiveness of the body to applied force decrease with increased total mass. For flying vertebrates, contributions of the relatively heavy wings to whole-body rotational inertia are substantial, whereas the relatively light wings of many insect taxa suggest that rotational inertia is dominated by the contributions of body segments. In some circumstances, inertial features of wing design may be as significant as are their aerodynamic properties in influencing the rapidity of body rotations. Stability in flight requires force and moment balances that are usually attained via bilateral symmetry in wingbeat kinematics, whereas body roll and yaw derive from bilaterally asymmetric movements of both axial and appendicular structures. In many flying vertebrates, use of the tail facilitates the generation of aerodynamic torques and substantially enhances quickness of body rotation. Geometrical constraints on wingbeat kinematics may limit total force production and thus accelerational capacity in certain behavioral circumstances. Unitary limits to animal flight performance and maneuverability are unlikely, however, given varied and context-specific interactions among anatomical, biomechanical, and energetic features of design.},

abstract = {The behaviour of a passive system of two-dimensional linked rigid bodies in the wake of a circular cylinder at Re=100 is studied computationally. The three rigid bodies are connected by two frictionless hinges, and the system (‘fish') is initially aligned with a streamwise axis three diameters behind the cylinder. Once flow symmetry is broken, the wake rolls up into a K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street in which the fish is stably trapped, and the passing large-scale vortices induce an undulatory shape change in the articulated system. It is found that, for certain fish lengths relative to cylinder diameter, the fish is propelled upstream toward the cylinder. Furthermore, the fish is propelled equally effectively when the hinges are locked, confirming that induced body undulation is not necessary for achieving a net thrust. An analysis of the forces on constituent bodies shows that leading-edge suction and negative skin friction on the forward portion of the fish are in competition with positive skin friction on the aft portion; propulsion is achieved when the forebody contributions dominate those on the aftbody. It is shown that the so-called ‘suction zone' behind the cylinder that enables this passive propulsion is double the length of that without a fish present.},

abstract = {The conventional aerodynamic analysis of flapping animal flight invokes the `quasisteady assumption' to reduce a problem in dynamics to a succession of static conditions: it is assumed that the instantaneous forces on a flapping wing are equivalent to those for steady motion at the same instantaneous velocity and angle of attack. The validity of this assumption and the importance of unsteady aerodynamic effects have long been controversial topics. Weis-Fogh tested the assumption for hovering animal flight, where unsteady effects are most pronounced, and concluded that most insects indeed hover according to the principles of quasi-steady aerodynamics. The logical basis for his conclusion is reviewed in this paper, and it is shown that the available evidence remains ambiguous. The aerodynamics of hovering insect flight are re-examined in this series of six papers, and a conclusion opposite to Weis-Fogh's is tentatively reached. New morphological and kinematic data for a variety of insects are presented in papers II and III, respectively. Paper IV offers an aerodynamic interpretation of the wing kinematics and a discussion on the possible roles of different aerodynamic mechanisms. A generalized vortex theory of hovering flight is derived in paper V, and provides a method of estimating the mean lift, induced power and induced velocity for unsteady as well as quasi-steady flight mechanisms. The new data, aerodynamic mechanisms and vortex theory are all combined in paper VI for an analysis of the lift and power requirements and other mechanical aspects of hovering flight. A large number of symbols are needed for the morphological, kinematic and aerodynamic analyses. Most of them appear in more than one paper of the series, and so a single comprehensive table defining the major symbols from all of the papers is presented at the end of this paper.

abstract = {To evaluate the swimming performances of aquatic animals, an important dimensionless quantity is the Strouhal number, St = fA/U, with f the tail-beat frequency, A the peak-to-peak tail amplitude, and U the swimming velocity. Experiments with flapping foils have exhibited maximum propulsive efficiency in the interval 0.25 {\textless} St {\textless} 0.35 and it has been argued that animals likely evolved to swim in the same narrow interval. Using Lighthill's elongated-body theory to address undulatory propulsion, it is demonstrated here that the optimal Strouhal number increases from 0.15 to 0.8 for animals spanning from the largest cetaceans to the smallest tadpoles. To assess the validity of this model, the swimming kinematics of 53 different species of aquatic animals have been compiled from the literature and it shows that their Strouhal numbers are consistently near the predicted optimum.},

abstract = {The cause of the changes in wing pitch at stroke reversal in Diptera has been investigated. The high compliance of the wing base makes it seem unlikely that pitch changes are caused by active torsion at the wing articulation. The centre of mass of insect wings tends to be behind the centre of torsion of the wing, and it is proposed that wing inertia about the torsional axis alone is responsible for pitch changes as the wing is accelerated at stroke reversal. A simplified inertial model is developed to calculate the angular velocity about the torsional axis that would be caused by wing inertia. The mass distribution and the torsional axis of the wings of two species of flies was found and it was shown that in these animals inertial causesalone could develop the angular velocity in the pitching plane that is observed at stroke reversal. Analysis of the movement of individual regions of the wing shows further that inertial effects will produce the tip to base torsion wave seen inthe wing at stroke reversal.},

The quasi-steady wing aerodynamics model is extended by including perturbation states from equilibrium and paired with rigid body equations of motion to create a nonlinear simulation of a Drosophila-like insect. Frequency-based system identification tools are used to identify the transfer functions from biologically inspired control inputs to rigid body states. Stability derivatives and a state space linear system describing the dynamics are also identified. The vehicle control requirements are quantified with respect to traditional human pilot handling qualities specification. The heave dynamics are found to be decoupled from the pitch/fore/aft dynamics. The haltere-on system revealed a stabilized system with a slow (heave) and fast subsidence mode, and a stable oscillatory mode. The haltere-off (bare airframe) system revealed a slow (heave) and fast subsidence mode and an unstable oscillatory mode, a modal structure in agreement with CFD studies. The analysis indicates that passive aerodynamic mechanisms contribute to stability, which may help explain how insects are able to achieve stable locomotion on a very small computational budget.},

The present study is a numerical investigation of the thrust generation and flow-field characteristics of a two-dimensional flapping flexible membrane, fixed at its leading edge. To study the time-dependent response of the membranes, a fluid/structure solver that couples a compact finite-difference immersed boundary method flow solver with a thin-membrane structural solver was developed. Using a body-fitted grid, external forcing to the structure is calculated from the boundary fluid dynamics. A systematic series of runs of the fluid/structure solver was performed in order to obtain a clear picture of the thrust-producing characteristics of membranes with bending rigidities ranging between EI = 5 6 and EI = 2 5 and structural mass coefficients between sh = 0.04, for a Reynolds number of Re = 851.},

More recent theoretical studies(9-12) have emphasized the role played by deterministic chaos, although many experimental studies(1,5-8,13,14) were performed before the development of such ideas. Here we report experimental observations of the dynamics of disks falling in water/glycerol mixtures. We find four distinct types of motion, which are mapped out in a 'phase diagram'. The apparently complex behaviour can be reduced to a series of one-dimensional maps, which display a discontinuity at the crossover from periodic to chaotic motion. This discontinuity leads to an unusual intermittency transition(15), not previously observed experimentally, between the two behaviours.},

abstract = {The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a widely used model organism in studies of genetics, developmental biology and biomechanics. One limitation for exploiting Drosophila as a model system for behavioral neurobiology is that measuring body kinematics during behavior is labor intensive and subjective. In order to quantify flight kinematics during different types of maneuvers, we have developed a visual tracking system that estimates the posture of the fly from multiple calibrated cameras. An accurate geometric fly model is designed using unit quaternions to capture complex body and wing rotations, which are automatically fitted to the images in each time frame. Our approach works across a range of flight behaviors, while also being robust to common environmental clutter. The tracking system is used in this paper to compare wing and body motion during both voluntary and escape take-offs. Using our automated algorithms, we are able to measure stroke amplitude, geometric angle of attack and other parameters important to a mechanistic understanding of flapping flight. When compared with manual tracking methods, the algorithm estimates body position within 4.4+/-1.3{\%} of the body length, while body orientation is measured within 6.5+/-1.9 deg. (roll), 3.2+/-1.3 deg. (pitch) and 3.4+/-1.6 deg. (yaw) on average across six videos. Similarly, stroke amplitude and deviation are estimated within 3.3 deg. and 2.1 deg., while angle of attack is typically measured within 8.8 deg. comparing against a human digitizer. Using our automated tracker, we analyzed a total of eight voluntary and two escape take-offs. These sequences show that Drosophila melanogaster do not utilize clap and fling during take-off and are able to modify their wing kinematics from one wingstroke to the next. Our approach should enable biomechanists and ethologists to process much larger datasets than possible at present and, therefore, accelerate insight into the mechanisms of free-flight maneuvers of flying insects.},

We then replayed the wing kinematics on a dynamically scaled robotic model to measure the aerodynamic forces produced by the wings. The results show that a fly generates rapid turns with surprisingly subtle modifications in wing motion, which nonetheless generate sufficient torque for the fly to rotate its body through each turn. The magnitude and time course of the torque and body motion during rapid turns indicate that inertia, not friction, dominates the flight dynamics of insects.},

abstract = {Using 3D infrared high-speed video, we captured the continuous wing and body kinematics of free-flying fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, during hovering and slow forward flight. We then 'replayed' the wing kinematics on a dynamically scaled robotic model to measure the aerodynamic forces produced by the wings. Hovering animals generate a U-shaped wing trajectory, in which large drag forces during a downward plunge at the start of each stroke create peak vertical forces. Quasi-steady mechanisms could account for nearly all of the mean measured force required to hover, although temporal discrepancies between instantaneous measured forces and model predictions indicate that unsteady mechanisms also play a significant role. We analyzed the requirements for hovering from an analysis of the time history of forces and moments in all six degrees of freedom. The wing kinematics necessary to generate sufficient lift are highly constrained by the requirement to balance thrust and pitch torque over the stroke cycle. We also compare the wing motion and aerodynamic forces of free and tethered flies. Tethering causes a strong distortion of the stroke pattern that results in a reduction of translational forces and a prominent nose-down pitch moment. The stereotyped distortion under tethered conditions is most likely due to a disruption of sensory feedback. Finally, we calculated flight power based directly on the measurements of wing motion and aerodynamic forces, which yielded a higher estimate of muscle power during free hovering flight than prior estimates based on time-averaged parameters. This discrepancy is mostly due to a two- to threefold underestimate of the mean profile drag coefficient in prior studies. We also compared our values with the predictions of the same time-averaged models using more accurate kinematic and aerodynamic input parameters based on our high-speed videography measurements. In this case, the time-averaged models tended to overestimate flight costs.},

@article{Fu2014,
abstract = {Morphology as well as kinematics is a critical de- terminant of performance in flapping flight. To understand the effects of the structural traits on aerodynamics of bio- flyers, three rectangular wings with aspect ratios (AR) of 1, 2, and 4 performing hovering-like sinusoidal kinematics at wingtip based Reynolds number of 5 300 are experimen- tally investigated. Flowstructures on sectional cuts along the wing span are compared. Stronger K-H instability is found on the leading edge vortex of wings with higher aspect ra- tios. Vortex bursting only appears on the outer spanwise lo- cations of high-aspect-ratio wings. The vortex bursting on high-aspect-ratio wings is perhaps one of the reasons why bio-flyers normally have low-aspect-ratio wings. Quantita- tive analysis exhibits larger dimensionless circulation of the leading edge vortex (LEV) over higher aspect ratio wings except when vortex bursting happens. The average dimen- sionless circulation of AR1 and AR2 along the span almost equals the dimensionless circulation at the 50{\%} span. The flow structure and the circulation analysis show that the si- nusoidal kinematics suppresses breakdown of the LEV com- pared with simplified flapping kinematics used in similar studies. The Reynolds number effect results on AR4 show that in the current Re range, the overall flow structure is not sensitive to Reynolds number.},

abstract = {We study the problem of optimizing admission control policies in mobile multimedia cellular networks when predictive information regarding movement is available and we evaluate the gains that can be achieved by making such predictive information available to the admission controller. We consider a general class of prediction agents which forecast the number of future handovers and we evaluate the impact on performance of aspects like: whether the prediction refers to incoming and/or outgoing handovers, inaccurate predictions, the anticipation of the prediction and the way that predictions referred to different service classes are aggregated. For the optimization process we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning approach based on the concept of afterstates. The proposed approach, when compared with conventional Reinforcement Learning, yields better solutions and with higher precision. Besides it tackles more efficiently the curse of dimensionality inherent to multimedia scenarios. Numerical 
results show that the performance gains measured are higher when more specific information is provided about the handover time instants, i.e. when the anticipation time is deterministic instead of stochastic. It is also shown that the utilization of the network is maintained at very high values, even when the highest improvements are observed. We also compare an optimal policy obtained deploying our approach with a previously proposed heuristic prediction scheme, showing that plenty of room for technological innovation exists.

A geometric nonlinear control system is presented to exponentially stabilize the position of the quadrotor while aligning the links to the vertical direction below the quadrotor. Numerical simulation and experimental results are presented and a rigorous stability analysis is provided to confirm the accuracy of our derivations.

abstract = {Convincing evidence that migrant monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) use a magnetic compass to aid their fall migration has been lacking from the spectacular navigational capabilities of this species. Here we use flight simulator studies to show that migrants indeed possess an inclination magnetic compass to help direct their flight equatorward in the fall. The use of this inclination compass is light-dependent utilizing ultraviolet-A/blue light between 380 and 420 nm. Notably, the significance of light {\textless}420 nm for inclination compass function was not considered in previous monarch studies. The antennae are important for the inclination compass because they appear to contain light-sensitive magnetosensors. For migratory monarchs, the inclination compass may serve as an important orientation mechanism when directional daylight cues are unavailable and may also augment time-compensated sun compass orientation for appropriate directionality throughout the migration.},

abstract = {In this paper, a framework for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to the design and control of power system stabilizers (PSSs) is proposed. A near-optimal coordinated design for several PSSs is achieved using reinforcement learning. The objective of the control policy is to enhance the stability of a multi-machine power system by increasing the damping ratio of the least-damped modes. An RL method called Q-learning is applied to find a near-optimal control policy for controlling PSSs. With this control policy, the agent can change the gain of PSSs automatically in such a way that a predefined goal is nearly always satisfied. A modified Q-learning algorithm is proposed to enhance the convergence speed of the conventional algorithm toward a near-optimal policy. This is achieved by using selective initial state criteria instead of choosing the initial state randomly in each episode. The validity of the proposed method has been tested on a two-area, four-machine power system using nonlinear time-
domain simulation under severe disturbances. {\&}copy; 2005 IEEE.},

abstract = {We use a comparative approach to examine some of the physiological traits that make flight possible. Comparisons of related fliers and runners suggest that fliers generally have higher aerobic metabolic capacities than runners but that the difference is highly dependent on the taxa studied. The high metabolic rates of fliers relative to runners, especially in insects, are correlated with high locomotory muscle cycle frequencies and low efficiencies of conversion of metabolic power to mechanical power. We examine some factors that produce variation in flight respiration and energetics. Air temperature strongly affects the flight metabolic rate of some insects and birds. Flight speed interacts with flier mass, so that small fliers tend to exhibit a J-shaped power curve and larger fliers a U-shaped power curve. As body size increases, mass-specific aerobic flight metabolism decreases in most studies, but mass-specific power output is constant or increases, leading to an increase in efficiency with size. Intraspecific studies have revealed specific genetically based effects on flight metabolism and power output and multiple ecological correlates of flight capabilities.},

abstract = {A novel adaptive-critic-based neural network (NN) controller in discrete time is designed to deliver a desired tracking performance for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of actuator constraints. The constraints of the actuator are treated in the controller design as the saturation nonlinearity. The adaptive critic NN controller architecture based on state feedback includes two NNs: The critic NN is used to approximate the ``strategic'' utility function, whereas the action NN is employed to minimize both the strategic utility function and the unknown nonlinear dynamic estimation errors. The critic and action NN weight updates are derived by minimizing certain quadratic performance indexes. Using the Lyapunov approach and with novel weight updates, the uniformly ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop tracking error and weight estimates is shown in the presence of NN approximation errors and bounded unknown disturbances. The proposed NN controller works in the presence of multiple 
nonlinearities, unlike other schemes that normally approximate one nonlinearity. Moreover, the adaptive critic NN controller does not require an explicit offline training phase, and the NN weights can be initialized at zero or random. Simulation results justify the theoretical analysis. {\&}copy; 2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Water tunnel experiments on a flexible airfoil plunging with constant amplitude have been carried out for Reynolds numbers of 0 to 27000. Peaks in thrust coefficient at intermediate values of airfoil stiffness were observed at both zero and non-zero Reynolds numbers, indicating that a degree of flexibility is beneficial at low Reynolds numbers. Time-averaged velocity fields and momentum flux data revealed a broader, higher-velocity jet in cases of optimum airfoil stiffness. Stronger vortices, separated by a larger lateral distance, characterised the corresponding instantaneous velocity fields. The flexibility causes the airfoil to pitch passively; the phase angle of the pitch was found to lead the plunge. Pitch amplitude and trailing-edge amplitude were found to be single-valued functions of pitch phase angle. The shape characteristics of the airfoil could therefore be described by the pitch phase angle only. Thrust coefficient was found to be a function of only two parameters: Strouhal number and pitch phase angle. For each Strouhal number, a peak in thrust coefficient was observed at a particular value of the pitch phase angle. The optimum pitch phase angle was found to tend to a limit of 105{\{}$\backslash$pm{\}}5 degrees at very large Strouhal numbers. A significant thrust benefit was observed over very stiff airfoils when the optimum flexibility is utilized.},

Nevertheless, the quantitative analysis of these complex wake structures shows a degree of similarity among all the different wake patterns and a close agreement with standard quasi-steady aerodynamic models and predictions. At the same time, new data on the flow over a bat wing in mid-downstroke show that, at least in this case, such simplifications cannot be useful in describing in detail either the wing properties or control prospects. The reasons for these apparently divergent results are discussed and prospects for future advances are considered.},

Our understanding of these capabilities has recently been improved by the identification of a source of passive damping specific to flapping flight. Examining how this damping effect scales among different species and how it affects active manoeuvres as well as recovery from perturbations provides general insights into the flight of insects, birds and bats. These new damping models offer a means to predict manoeuvrability and stability for a wide variety of flying animals using prior reports of the morphology and flapping motions of these species. Furthermore, the presence of passive damping is likely to have facilitated the evolution of powered flight in animals by providing a stability benefit associated with flapping.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the flight characteristics of a swift (Apus apus) in cruising flight at three different flight speeds (8.0, 8.4 and 9.2 m s(-1)) in a low turbulence wind tunnel. The wingbeat kinematics were recorded by high-speed filming and the wake of the bird was visualized by digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). Certain flight characteristics of the swift differ from those of previously studied species. As the flight speed increases, the angular velocity of the wingbeat remains constant, and so as the wingbeat amplitude increases, the frequency decreases accordingly, as though the flight muscles were contracting at a fixed rate. The wings are also comparatively inflexible and are flexed or retracted rather little during the upstroke. The upstroke is always aerodynamically active and this is reflected in the wake, where shedding of spanwise vorticity occurs throughout the wingbeat. Although the wake superficially resembles those of other birds in cruising flight, with a pair of trailing wingtip vortices connected by spanwise vortices, the continuous shedding of first positive vorticity during the downstroke and then negative vorticity during the upstroke suggests a wing whose circulation is gradually increasing and then decreasing during the wingbeat cycle. The wake (and implied wing aerodynamics) are not well described by discrete vortex loop models, but a new wake-based model, where incremental spanwise and streamwise variations of the wake impulse are integrated over the wingbeat, shows good agreement of the vertical momentum flux with the required weight support. The total drag was also estimated from the wake alone, and the calculated lift:drag ratio of approximately 13 for flapping flight is the highest measured yet for birds.},

abstract = {The objective of this phase of the program was to show feasibility of a Martian atmosphere breathing Hall effect thruster (MABHET). To accomplish this objective, we set out to demonstrate that: 1) a Busek Hall effect thruster could operate on the Mars atmospheric gases, 2) the atmospheric conditions and orbital parameters required for the MABHET were indeed achievable, 3) further advancement of the inlet concept held credible, and 4) continued investigation into the remaining vehicle components including the cathode, power generation, size/mass and science remained feasible. We achieved all of these goals during the first phase of this program. One major achievement during this phase was the operation of a Busek HET with simulated Mars atmosphere. Two goals included an overall efficiency of at least 20{\%} and a maximum thrust to power ratio since the vehicle would likely be power limited. The HET was operated over a wide range of mass flow, applied anode voltage and overall power, simulating various potential altitudes and size of the thruster. Definitive thrust measurements prove that 20{\%} efficiency is indeed possible and likely on the low end of expected performance. The thrust to power ratio peaked around 30mN/kW with an efficiency around 22-25{\%}, depending on the operating conditions. This measured performance with be discussed in more detail below. Sizing of the vehicle, propulsion system and Mars atmosphere conditions also need to be confirmed that such a concept is feasible. The major drivers of this analysis are the vehicle drag and solar flux/collection. Utilizing current technology for spacecraft drag and solar arrays, the MABHET concept is right on the edge of feasibility. However, solar arrays are becoming more efficient on a study pace and drag in rarefied atmospheres is also becoming better understood. Minor improvements, in either or both of these areas, will confirm credibility to MABHET feasibility for future missions. The atmospheric inlet or propellant collector is a critical component for the MABHET concept to work. We chose to further our investigation of the inlet numerically utilizing DSMC and we found that shrinking the inlet proportionally for a smaller thruster/vehicle design also held performance, thus the focus on a lower power, smaller vehicle was also feasible. The inlet is the lead critical path component and needs to be investigated early in future programs. Finally, analysis and some experiments on the remaining propulsion system components and spacecraft design were initialized during phase I. This included some radio frequency cathode tests performed by Colorado State University. Though these tests were unsuccessful, rational for the failure and a path to success has been determined. We also began looking at the science made possible by this concept and who in the science community might be interested. Solar array advances and possible low drag surfaces are discussed.},

The proposed distributed learning and control (DLC) approach integrates part-driven distributed arrival time control (DATC) and machine-driven distributed reinforcement learning based control. With DATC, part controllers adjust their associated parts' arrival time to minimize due-date deviation. Within the restricted pattern of arrivals, machine controllers are concurrently searching for optimal dispatching policies. The machine control problem is modeled as Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) and solved using Q-learning. The DLC algorithms are evaluated using simulation for two types of manufacturing systems: family scheduling and dynamic batch sizing. Results show that DLC algorithms achieve significant performance improvement over usual dispatching rules in complex real-time shop floor control problems for JIT production.},

@article{Howard2009,
abstract = {The migration of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) from Canada and the United States to overwintering sites in Mexico is one of the world's most amazing biological phenomena, although recent threats make it imperative that the resources needed by migrating monarchs be conserved. The most important first step in preserving migration resources—determining the migration flyways—is also the most challenging because of the large-scale nature of the migration. Prior attempts to determine the flyways using mark-recapture techniques with wing tags gave some clues, but this important information has never been fully obtainable until now. In 2005 the citizen-science program, Journey North, initiated a project that asked participants to record sightings of overnight roosts of monarchs during their fall migration, and this project now provides an ideal way to illustrate the flyways used by monarchs on their way to Mexico, with the assumption that roost locations indicate migration routes. We used 3 years of this data to elucidate the flyways on a continent-wide scale, that revealed two distinct flyways, but only one appears to lead directly to Mexico. This main, ‘central' flyway begins in the American Midwest states and southern Ontario, then continues south-southwest through the states of Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas, and finally passes through Texas and northern Mexico. These data also highlighted a separate, smaller flyway along the eastern and coastal states, but there was a noticeable lack of roost sightings in this flyway at lower latitudes. Since there are few recoveries of marked monarchs in Mexico originating from coastal areas, we compared the timing of roost formation in this ‘eastern' flyway with the main, central flyway. Roosts in the eastern flyway lagged behind the central roosts in timing, suggesting that monarchs traveling in this flyway have a reduced chance of making it to the Mexico wintering site. Combined, our evidence indicates that locations in the central flyway should be considered priority areas for conserving migration resources.},

Associative reinforcement learning involves the trial and error interaction with a dynamic system to determine the control actions that optimally achieve some desired performance index. The methodology can be applied either on-line or off-line and in a model based or model free manner. Associative reinforcement learning techniques are applied to the optimal regulator (LQR) control of discrete-time linear systems. Adaptive critic designs are implemented and the convergence speed compared for the different approaches. These methods can determine the optimal state and state/action value function and the optimal policy without requiring system models.},

Tadarida brasiliensis, the Brazilian free-tailed bat, is an aerial hunter that annually migrates long distances and also differs strikingly from the previously investigated species morphologically. We compare the aerodynamics of T. brasiliensis with those of other, frugivorous bats and with common swifts, Apus apus, a bird with wing morphology, kinematics and flight ecology similar to that of these bats. The comparison reveals that, for the range of speeds evaluated, the cyclical pattern of aerodynamic forces associated with a wingbeat shows more similarities between T. brasiliensis and A. apus than between T. brasiliensis and other frugivorous bats.},

Since the wing and the surrounding fluid interact with each other, the dynamic similarity between the model flight and actual insect flight was measured using not only the non-dimensional numbers for the fluid (the Reynolds and Strouhal numbers) but also those for the fluid-structure interaction (the mass and Cauchy numbers). A difference was observed between the mass number of the model and that of the actual insect because of the limitation of available solid materials. However, the dynamic similarity during the flapping translation was not much affected by the mass number since the inertial force during the flapping translation is not dominant because of the small acceleration. In our model flight, a high angle of attack of the wing was maintained passively during the flapping translation and the wing generated sufficient lift force to support the insect weight. The mechanism of the maintenance is the equilibrium between the elastic reaction force resulting from the wing torsion and the fluid dynamic pressure. Our model wing rotated quickly at the stroke reversal in spite of the reduced inertial effect of the wing mass compared with that of the actual insect. This result could be explained by the added mass from the surrounding fluid. Our results suggest that the pitching motion can be passive in the crane fly's flapping flight.},

abstract = {Resolved computation of two dimensional insect hovering shows for the first time that a two dimensional hovering motion can generate enough lift to support a typical insect weight. The computation reveals a two dimensional mechanism of creating a downward dipole jet of counterrotating vortices, which are formed from leading and trailing edge vortices. The vortex dynamics further elucidates the role of the phase relation between the wing translation and rotation in lift generation and explains why the instantaneous forces can reach a periodic state after only a few strokes. The model predicts the lower limits in Reynolds number and amplitude above which the averaged forces are sufficient.},

abstract = {In Lepidoptera, forewings and hindwings are mechanically coupled and flap in synchrony. Flight is anteromotoric, being driven primarily by action of the forewings. Here we report that lepidopterans can still fly when their hindwings are cut off, a procedure reducing their total wing surface, on average, by nearly one half. However, as we demonstrate by analysis of three-dimensional flight trajectories of a moth and a butterfly (Lymantria dispar and Pieris rapae), hindwing removal causes lepidopterans to incur a loss in both linear and turning acceleration, so that they are unable to exercise their normal flight maneuverability. Without hindwings they still are able to zigzag aerially (the ablation has no effect on their turning radius in flight) but at lesser speed and therefore less evasively. Consequently, hindwings in the expanded state in which they occur in lepidopterans seem to contribute in an essential way to lepidopteran survival. Moths in today's world, we argue, may rely on their evasive flight primarily to avoid capture by bats, whereas butterflies, which we propose advertise their evasiveness collectively through shared aposematism, may depend upon it primarily for defense against birds. Aerial agility thus may be the chief adaptive asset derived by lepidopterans from possession of oversize hindwings.},

abstract = {The geometric conservation law (GCL) is an important concept for moving grid techniques because it directly regulates the treatments of the fluid flow and grid movement. With the grid movement at every time instant, the Jacobian, associated with the volume of each element in curvilinear co-ordinates, needs to be updated in a conservative manner. In this study, alternative GCL schemes for evaluating the Jacobian have been investigated in the context of a pressure-based Navier-Stokes solver, utilizing moving grid and the first-order implicit time stepping procedure as well as the PISO scheme. GCL-based on first and second-order, implicit as well as time-averaged, time integration schemes were considered. Accuracy and conservative properties were tested on steady-state, laminar flow inside a 2D channel and time dependent, turbulent flow around a 3D elastic wing; both treated with moving grid techniques. It seems that the formal order of accuracy is not a decisive indicator. Instead, the speed of grid movement and the interplay between the flow solver and the GCL treatments make a more noticeable impact.},

abstract = {We report a comprehensive scaling law and novel lift generation mechanisms relevant to the aerodynamic functions of structural flexibility in insect flight. Using a Navier–Stokes equation solver, fully coupled to a structural dynamics solver, we consider the hovering motion of a wing of insect size, in which the dynamics of fluid–structure interaction leads to passive wing rotation. Lift generated on the flexible wing scales with the relative shape deformation parameter, whereas the optimal lift is obtained when the wing deformation synchronizes with the imposed translation, consistent with previously reported observations for fruit flies and honeybees. Systematic comparisons with rigid wings illustrate that the nonlinear response in wing motion results in a greater peak angle compared with a simple harmonic motion, yielding higher lift. Moreover, the compliant wing streamlines its shape via camber deformation to mitigate the nonlinear lift-degrading wing–wake interaction to further enhance lift. These bioinspired aeroelastic mechanisms can be used in the development of flapping wing micro-robots.},

The time averaging results in a simplified model which approximates the high frequency time varying dynamics of the original system.

is developed by combining the optimal membrane element and discrete
Kirchhoff triangle (DKT) plate bending element, and is modified for
laminated composite plates and shells so as to include the membrane-bending
coupling effect. Using appropriate shape functions for the bending
and membrane modes of the element, the ‘inconsistent' stress
stiffness matrix is formulated and the tangent stiffness matrix is
determined. Non-linear analysis of thin-walled structures with geometric
non-linearity is conducted using the corotational method. The new
element is thoroughly tested by solving few popular benchmark problems.
The results of the analysis are compared with those obtained using
existing membrane elements. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006 John Wiley {\&} Sons,

abstract = {Several characteristics of drag-based paddling propulsion are studied with a simple mechanical model and a measurement technique for mapping three-dimensional flow fields. In drag-based propulsion, the temporal change of the vortex strength is an important parameter in the relationship between vortex formation and thrust generation. Our results indicate that spanwise flow behind the paddling propulsor significantly affects tip vortex development and thrust generation. The distribution of spanwise flow is dependent on the propulsor shape and the Reynolds number. A delta-shaped propulsor generates strong spanwise flow compared with a rectangular propulsor. For the low Reynolds number case, spanwise flow is not as strong as that for the high Reynolds number case. Without sacrificing total impulse, the flexible propulsor can smooth out thrust peaks during sudden stroke motions, which is favorable for avoiding structural failures and stabilizing body motion. We also explored the role of stopping vortex shedding in efficient thrust generation by determining the relationship between stroke angles and total impulses generated by paddling propulsors.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic performance and energetic savings for flight in ground effect are theoretically maximized during hovering, but have never been directly measured for flying animals. We evaluated flight kinematics, metabolic rates and induced flow velocities for Anna's hummingbirds hovering at heights (relative to wing length R = 5.5 cm) of 0.7R, 0.9R, 1.1R, 1.7R, 2.2R and 8R above a solid surface. Flight at heights less than or equal to 1.1R resulted in significant reductions in the body angle, tail angle, anatomical stroke plane angle, wake-induced velocity, and mechanical and metabolic power expenditures when compared with flight at the control height of 8R. By contrast, stroke plane angle relative to horizontal, wingbeat amplitude and wingbeat frequency were unexpectedly independent of height from ground. Qualitative smoke visualizations suggest that each wing generates a vortex ring during both down- and upstroke. These rings expand upon reaching the ground and present a complex turbulent interaction below the bird's body. Nonetheless, hovering near surfaces results in substantial energetic benefits for hummingbirds, and by inference for all volant taxa that either feed at flowers or otherwise fly close to plant or other surfaces.},

abstract = {This paper presents a control effectiveness analysis of the hawkmoth Manduca sexta. A multibody dynamic model of the insect that considers the time-varying inertia of two flapping wings is established, based on measurement data from the real hawk moth. A six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) multibody fight dynamics simulation environment is used to analyze the effectiveness of the control variables defined in a wing kinematics function. The aerodynamics from complex wing flapping motions is estimated by a blade element approach, including translational and rotational force coefficients derived from relevant experimental studies. Control characteristics of fight dynamics with respect to the changes of three angular degrees of freedom (stroke positional, feathering, and deviation angle) of the wing kinematics are investigated. Results show that the symmetric (asymmetric) wing kinematics change of each wing only affects the longitudinal (lateral) fight forces and moments, which implies that the 
longitudinal and lateral fight controls are decoupled. However, there are coupling effects within each plane of motion. In the longitudinal plane, pitch and forward/backward motion controls are coupled; in the lateral plane, roll and side-translation motion controls are coupled. {\&}copy; The Korean Society for Aeronautical {\&} Space Sciences.},

abstract = {Insect wings demonstrate elaborate three-dimensional deformations and kinematics. These deformations are key to understanding many aspects of insect flight including aerodynamics, structural dynamics and control. In this paper, we propose a template-based subdivision surface reconstruction method that is capable of reconstructing the wing deformations and kinematics of free-flying insects based on the output of a high-speed camera system. The reconstruction method makes no rigid wing assumptions and allows for an arbitrary arrangement of marker points on the interior and edges of each wing. The resulting wing surfaces are projected back into image space and compared with expert segmentations to validate reconstruction accuracy. A least squares plane is then proposed as a universal reference to aid in making repeatable measurements of the reconstructed wing deformations. Using an Eastern pondhawk (Erythimus simplicicollis) dragonfly for demonstration, we quantify and visualize the wing twist and camber in both the chord-wise and span-wise directions, and discuss the implications of the results. In particular, a detailed analysis of the subtle deformation in the dragonfly's right hindwing suggests that the muscles near the wing root could be used to induce chord-wise camber in the portion of the wing nearest the specimen's body. We conclude by proposing a novel technique for modeling wing corrugation in the reconstructed flapping wings. In this method, displacement mapping is used to combine wing surface details measured from static wings with the reconstructed flapping wings, while not requiring any additional information be tracked in the high speed camera output.},

abstract = {Alternating gliding and active propulsion is a potentially energy saving strategy for small-scale flight. With the goal of finding optimal wing shapes for flapping-gliding robots we evaluate the quasi-steady aerodynamic performance of four butterfly species (Monarch (Danaus plexippus), the Orange Aeroplane (Pantoporia consimilis), the Glasswing (Acraea andromacha) and the Four-barred Swordtail (Protographium Ieosthenes)). We fabricate at-scale wing models based on measured wing shapes and vary the forewing angle in nine steps to account for the ability of the butterfly to change the relative orientation of its forewing and hindwing during flight. For comparison we include twelve non-biological planforms as performance benchmarks for the butterfly wing shapes. We then test these 48 wing models at 2m/s, 3.5m/s and 5m/s (Reynolds number between 2597 and 12632) in a low speed wind tunnel which allows lift and drag force measurements of centimeter-size wings. The results indicate that the forewing orientation which maximizes the wing span offers the best gliding performance and that overall the gliding ratios are highest at 3.5m/s. The wing shapes with the best gliding ratio are found in the Glasswing butterfly with a maximum of 6.26 which is very high compared to the gliding performance of similarly sized flying robots. The results from this study are important for the development of novel biologically-inspired flying micro robots as well as for biomechanics studies in biology.},

This provides powerful closed-loop robustness guarantees. but can result in controllers that are conservative with regard to performance. We present an approach to learning a better controller through observing actual controlled behaviour. A neural network is placed in parallel with the robust controller and is trained through reinforcement learning to optimize performance over time. By analysing nonlinear and time-varying aspects of a neural network via uncertainty models, a robust reinforcement learning procedure results that is guaranteed to remain stable even as the neural network is being trained. The behaviour of this procedure is demonstrated and analysed on two control tasks. Results show that at intermediate stages the system without robust constraints goes through a period of unstable behaviour that is avoided when the robust constraints are included},

One type, a feedback linearization controller involves high-order derivative terms and turns Out to be quite sensitive to sensor noise as well as Modeling uncertainty. The second type involves a new approach to an adaptive sliding mode controller using input augmentation in order to account for the underactuated property of the helicopter, sensor noise, and uncertainty without using control inputs of large magnitude. The sliding mode controller performs very well under noisy conditions, and adaptation can effectively estimate uncertainty such as ground effects.},

abstract = {During tethered flight in Drosophila melanogaster, spike activity of the second basalar flight-control muscle (M.b2) is correlated with an increase in both the ipsilateral wing beat amplitude and the ipsilateral flight force. The frequency of muscle spikes within a burst is about 100 Hz, or 1 spike for every two wing beat cycles. When M.b2 is active, its spikes tend to occur within a comparatively narrow phase band of the wing beat cycle. To understand the functional role of this phase-lock of firing in the control of flight forces, we stimulated M.b2 in selected phases of the wing beat cycle and recorded the effect on the ipsilateral wing beat amplitude. Varying the phase timing of the stimulus had a significant effect on the wing beat amplitude. A maximum increase of wing beat amplitude was obtained by stimulating M.b2 at the beginning of the upstroke or about 1 ms prior to the narrow phase band in which the muscle spikes typically occur during flight. Assuming a delay of 1 ms between the stimulation of the motor nerve and muscle activation, these results indicate that M.b2 is activated at an instant of the stroke cycle that produces the greatest effect on wing beat amplitude.},

abstract = {Recent studies have revealed a diverse array of fluid dynamic phenomena that enhance lift production during flapping insect flight. Physical and analytical models of oscillating wings have demonstrated that a prominent vortex attached to the wing's leading edge augments lift production throughout the translational parts of the stroke cycle, whereas aerodynamic circulation due to wing rotation, and possibly momentum transfer due to a recovery of wake energy, may increase lift at the end of each half stroke. Compared to the predictions derived from conventional steady-state aerodynamic theory, these unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms may account for the majority of total lift produced by a flying insect. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep the insect aloft, manipulation of the translational and rotational aerodynamic mechanisms may provide a potent means by which a flying animal can modulate direction and magnitude of flight forces for manoeuvring flight control and steering behaviour. The attainment of flight, including the ability to control aerodynamic forces by the neuromuscular system, is a classic paradigm of the remarkable adaptability that flying insects have for utilising the principles of unsteady fluid dynamics. Applying these principles to biology broadens our understanding of how the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by the different insect species have been developed throughout their long evolutionary history.},

abstract = {The limits of flight performance have been estimated in tethered Drosophila melanogaster by modulating power requirements in a 'virtual reality' flight arena. At peak capacity, the flight muscles can sustain a mechanical power output of nearly 80 W kg-1 muscle mass at 24 degrees C, which is sufficient to generate forces of approximately 150{\%} of the animal's weight. The increase in flight force above that required to support body weight is accompanied by a rise in wing velocity, brought about by an increase in stroke amplitude and a decrease in stroke frequency. Inertial costs, although greater than either profile or induced power, would be minimal with even modest amounts of elastic storage, and total mechanical power energy should be equivalent to aerodynamic power alone. Because of the large profile drag expected at low Reynolds numbers, the profile power was approximately twice the induced power at all levels of force generation. Thus, it is the cost of overcoming drag, and not the production of lift, that is the primary requirement for flight in Drosophila melanogaster. By comparing the estimated mechanical power output with respirometrically measured total power input, we determined that muscle efficiency rises with increasing force production to a maximum of 10{\%}. This change in efficiency may reflect either increased crossbridge activation or a favorable strain regime during the production of peak forces.},

abstract = {Manoeuvring flight in animals requires precise adjustments of mechanical power output produced by the flight musculature. In many insects such as fruit flies, power generation is most likely varied by altering stretch-activated tension, that is set by sarcoplasmic calcium levels. The muscles reside in a thoracic shell that simultaneously drives both wings during wing flapping. Using a genetically expressed muscle calcium indicator, we here demonstrate in vivo the ability of this animal to bilaterally adjust its calcium activation to the mechanical power output required to sustain aerodynamic costs during flight. Motoneuron-specific comparisons of calcium activation during lift modulation and yaw turning behaviour suggest slightly higher calcium activation for dorso-longitudinal than for dorsoventral muscle fibres, which corroborates the elevated need for muscle mechanical power during the wings' downstroke. During turning flight, calcium activation explains only up to 54 per cent of the required changes in mechanical power, suggesting substantial power transmission between both sides of the thoracic shell. The bilateral control of muscle calcium runs counter to the hypothesis that the thorax of flies acts as a single, equally proportional source for mechanical power production for both flapping wings. Collectively, power balancing highlights the precision with which insects adjust their flight motor to changing energetic requirements during aerial steering. This potentially enhances flight efficiency and is thus of interest for the development of technical vehicles that employ bioinspired strategies of power delivery to flapping wings.},

abstract = {Flapping wings enable flying animals and biomimetic robots to generate elevated aerodynamic forces. Measurements that demonstrate this capability are based on experiments with tethered robots and animals, and indirect force calculations based on measured kinematics or airflow during free flight. Remarkably, there exists no method to measure these forces directly during free flight. Such in vivo recordings in freely behaving animals are essential to better understand the precise aerodynamic function of their flapping wings, in particular during the downstroke versus upstroke. Here, we demonstrate a new aerodynamic force platform (AFP) for non-intrusive aerodynamic force measurement in freely flying animals and robots. The platform encloses the animal or object that generates fluid force with a physical control surface, which mechanically integrates the net aerodynamic force that is transferred to the earth. Using a straightforward analytical solution of the Navier-Stokes equation, we verified that the method is accurate. We subsequently validated the method with a quadcopter that is suspended in the AFP and generates unsteady thrust profiles. These independent measurements confirm that the AFP is indeed accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the AFP by studying aerodynamic weight support of a freely flying bird in vivo. These measurements confirm earlier findings based on kinematics and flow measurements, which suggest that the avian downstroke, not the upstroke, is primarily responsible for body weight support during take-off and landing.},

abstract = {Organisms that swim or fly with fins or wings physically interact with the surrounding water and air. The interactions are governed by the morphology and kinematics of the locomotory system that form boundary conditions to the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations. These equations represent Newton's law of motion for the fluid surrounding the organism. Several dimensionless numbers, such as the Reynolds number and Strouhal number, measure the influence of morphology and kinematics on the fluid dynamics of swimming and flight. There exists, however, no coherent theoretical framework that shows how such dimensionless numbers of organisms are linked to the NS equation. Here we present an integrated approach to scale the biological fluid dynamics of a wing that flaps, spins or translates. Both the morphology and kinematics of the locomotory system are coupled to the NS equation through which we find dimensionless numbers that represent rotational accelerations in the flow due to wing kinematics and morphology. The three corresponding dimensionless numbers are (1) the angular acceleration number, (2) the centripetal acceleration number, and (3) the Rossby number, which measures Coriolis acceleration. These dimensionless numbers consist of length scale ratios, which facilitate their geometric interpretation. This approach gives fundamental insight into the physical mechanisms that explain the differences in performance among flapping, spinning and translating wings. Although we derived this new framework for the special case of a model fly wing, the method is general enough to make it applicable to other organisms that fly or swim using wings or fins.},

However, insects' aerial environment is filled with swirling eddies and wind gusts, and large disturbances are common. Here, we numerically solve the equations of motion coupled with the Navier-Stokes equations to simulate the large disturbance motions and analyse the nonlinear flight dynamics of hovering model insects. We consider two representative model insects, a model hawkmoth (large size, low wingbeat frequency) and a model dronefly (small size, high wingbeat frequency). For small and large initial disturbances, the disturbance motion grows with time, and the insects tumble and never return to the equilibrium state; the hovering flight is inherently (passively) unstable. The instability is caused by a pitch moment produced by forward/backward motion and/or a roll moment produced by side motion of the insect.},

abstract = {In this paper, an H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} reinforcement learning controller based on a fuzzy wavelet network (FWN) is proposed to perform a position-tracking task for a robot manipulator. The proposed controller adopts the actor-critic reinforcement learning control scheme. The primary reinforcement is generated by a performance measurement unit. The learning unit of the controller consists of an associative search network (ASN) and an adaptive critic network (ACN). The ASN is employed to approximate unknown nonlinear functions in the robot dynamics and the ACN is utilized to construct a more informative signal than the primary reinforcement alone to tune the ASN. Since the FWN can provide accurate function approximation, both the ASN and ACN are implemented by the FWN. In addition, the proposed controller requires no prior knowledge about the dynamics of the robot manipulators and no off-line learning phase. Moreover, by employing the H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} control theory, it is possible to attenuate 
the effects of the approximation errors of the FWNs and external disturbances to a prescribed level. In contrast to the general H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} problem, only simple equations, rather than Riccati equations, should be solved. Computer simulations on a SCARA robot with 3 degrees-of-freedom confirm the effectiveness of the FWN-based controller with H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{\&}infin;{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} stabilization. {\&}copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Measurements of the mass properties of the insect are used to parameterize a simple flight dynamics model of the butterfly. Even though the mass of the flapping wings is small compared to the total mass of the insect, these experiments and subsequent analysis indicate that changes in moment of inertia during flight are large enough to influence the manoeuvres of these insects.},

abstract = {The effects of wing–body interaction (WBI) on aerodynamic performance and vortex dynamics have been numerically investigated in the forward flight of cicadas. Flapping wing kinematics was reconstructed based on the output of a high-speed camera system. Following the reconstruction of cicada flight, three models, wing–body (WB), body-only (BD) and wings-only (WN), were then developed and evaluated using an immersed-boundary-method-based incompressible Navier–Stokes equations solver. Results have shown that due to WBIs, the WB model had a 18.7 {\%} increase in total lift production compared with the lift generated in both the BD and WN models, and about 65 {\%} of this enhancement was attributed to the body. This resulted from a dramatic improvement of body lift production from 2 {\%} to 11.6 {\%} of the total lift produced by the wing–body system. Further analysis of the associated near-field and far-field vortex structures has shown that this lift enhancement was attributed to the formation of two distinct vortices shed from the thorax and the posterior of the insect, respectively, and their interactions with the flapping wings. Simulations are also used to examine the new lift enhancement mechanism over a range of minimum wing–body distances, reduced frequencies and body inclination angles. This work provides a new physical insight into the understanding of the body-involved lift-enhancement mechanism in insect forward flight.},

We use the geometry of a Manduca sexta-based robotic wing to define the shape of a three-dimensional 'virtual' wing model and 'hover' this wing, mimicking accurately the three-dimensional movements of the wing of a hovering hawkmoth. Our CFD analysis has established an overall understanding of the viscous and unsteady flow around the flapping wing and of the time course of instantaneous force production, which reveals that hovering flight is dominated by the unsteady aerodynamics of both the instantaneous dynamics and also the past history of the wing. {\textless}P{\textgreater} A coherent leading-edge vortex with axial flow was detected during translational motions of both the up- and downstrokes. The attached leading-edge vortex causes a negative pressure region and, hence, is responsible for enhancing lift production. The axial flow, which is derived from the spanwise pressure gradient, stabilises the vortex and gives it a characteristic spiral conical shape. {\textless}P{\textgreater} The leading-edge vortex created during previous translational motion remains attached during the rotational motions of pronation and supination. This vortex, however, is substantially deformed due to coupling between the translational and rotational motions, develops into a complex structure, and is eventually shed before the subsequent translational motion. {\textless}P{\textgreater} Estimation of the forces during one complete flapping cycle shows that lift is produced mainly during the downstroke and the latter half of the upstroke, with little force generated during pronation and supination. The stroke plane angle that satisfies the horizontal force balance of hovering is 23.6 degrees , which shows excellent agreement with observed angles of approximately 20-25 degrees . The time-averaged vertical force is 40 {\%} greater than that needed to support the weight of the hawkmoth.},

The method is valid for three-dimensional attached flows around the actual planforms found on these animals and was used in the study reported here to assess the performance of the flukes of an immature fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus). It is shown that passive spanwise flexibility reduces propulsive efficiency, but that propulsive efficiency of these planforms can be increased, over the value for an equivalent rigid foil, by careful control of the phase of the spanwise flexibility relative to other motion parameters.},

abstract = {The effects of corrugation and wing planform (shape and aspect ratio) on the aerodynamic force production of model insect wings in sweeping, (rotating after an initial start) motion at Reynolds number 200 and 3500 at angle of attack 400 are investigated, using the method of computational fluid dynamics. A representative wing corrugation is considered. Wing-shape and aspect ratio (AR) of ten representative insect wings are considered; they are the wing's of fruit fly, cranefly, dronefly, hoverfly, ladybird, bumblebee, honeybee, lacewing (forewing), hawkmoth and dragonfly (forewing), respectively (AR of these wings varies greatly, from 2.84 to 5.45). The following facts are shown. (1) The corrugated and flat-plate wings produce approximately the same aerodynamic forces. This is because for a sweeping wing at large angle of attack, the length scale of the corrugation is much smaller than the size of the separated flow region or the size of the leading edge vortex (LEV). (2) The variation in wing shape can have considerable effects on the aerodynamic force; but it has only minor effects on the force coefficients when the velocity at r(2) (the radius of the second moment of wing area) is used as the reference velocity; i.e. the force coefficients are almost unaffected by the variation in wing shape. (3) The effects of AR are remarkably small: when AR increases from 2.8 to 5.5, the force coefficients vary only slightly; flowfield results show that when AR is relatively large, the part of the LEV on the outer part of the wings sheds during the sweeping motion. As AR is increased, on one hand, the force coefficients will be increased due to the reduction of 3-dimensional flow effects; on the other hand, they will be decreased due to the shedding of part of the LEV: these two effects approximately cancel each other, resulting in only minor change of the force coefficients.},

abstract = {Micro-aerial vehicles (MAV) and their promising applications - such as undetected surveillance or exploration of environments with little space for land-based maneuvers - are a well-known topic in the field of aerial robotics. Inspired by high maneuverability and agile flight of insects, over the past two decades a significant amount of effort has been dedicated to research on flapping-wing MAVs, most of which aim to address unique challenges in morphological construction, force production, and control strategy. Although remarkable solutions have been found for sufficient lift generation, effective methods for motion control still remain an open problem. The focus of this paper is to investigate general flight control mechanisms that are potentially used by real insects, thereby providing inspirations for flapping-wing MAV control. Through modeling the insect flight muscles, we show that stiffness and set point of the wing's joint can be respectively tuned to regulate the wing's lift and thrust 
forces. Therefore, employing a suitable controller with variable impedance actuators at each wing joint is a prospective approach to agile flight control of insect-inspired MAVs. The results of simulated flight experiments with one such controller are provided and support our claim. {\&}copy; 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Within the growing family of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles (MAV) are a relatively new field of research. Inspired by small size and agile flight of insects and birds, these systems offer a great potential for applications such as reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, mapping, etc. Nevertheless, practicality of these vehicles depends on how we address various challenges ranging from control methodology to morphological construction and power supply design. A reasonable approach to resolving such problems is to acquire further inspiration from solutions in nature. Through modeling synchronous muscles in insects, we have shown that manipulation of mechanical impedance properties at wing joints can be a very efficient method for controlling lift and thrust production in flapping-wing MAVs. In the present work, we describe how this approach can be used to decouple lift/thrust regulation, thus reducing the complexity of flight controller. Although of 
simple design, this controller is still capable of demonstrating a high degree of precision and maneuverability throughout various simulated flight experiments with different types of trajectories. Furthermore, we use these flight simulations to investigate the power requirements of our control approach. The results indicate that these characteristics are considerably lower compared to when conventional control strategies-methods that often rely on manipulating stroke properties such as frequency or magnitude of the flapping motion-are employed.

abstract = {In this paper a hybrid approach to the autonomous motion control of robots in cluttered environments with unknown obstacles is introduced. It is shown the efficiency of a hybrid solution by combining the optimization power of evolutionary algorithms and at the same time the efficiency of reinforcement learning in real-time and on-line situations. Experimental results concerning the navigation of a L-shaped robot in a cluttered environment with unknown obstacles are also presented. In such environments there appear real-time and on-line constraints well-suited to RL algorithms and, at the same time, there exists an extremely high dimension of the state space usually unpractical for RL algorithms but well-suited to evolutionary algorithms. The experimental results confirm the validity of the hybrid approach to solve hard real-time, on-line and high dimensional robot motion planning and control problems, where the RL approach shows some difficulties. {\&}copy; 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Insects flying with two pairs of wings must contend with the forewing wake passing over the beating hindwing. Some four-winged insects, such as dragonflies, move each wing independently and therefore may alter the relative timing between the fore- and hindwing stroke cycles. The significance of modifying the phase relationship between fore- and hindwing stroke kinematics on total lift production is difficult to assess in the flying animal because the effect of wing-wake interference critically depends on the complex wake pattern produced by the two beating wings. Here we investigate the effect of changing the fore- and hindwing stroke-phase relationship during hovering flight conditions on the aerodynamic performance of each flapping wing by using a dynamically scaled electromechanical insect model. By varying the relative phase difference between fore- and hindwing stroke cycles we found that the performance of the forewing remains approximately constant, while hindwing lift production may vary by a factor of two. Hindwing lift modulation appears to be due to two different fluid dynamic phenomenons: leading edge vortex destruction and changes in strength and orientation of the local flow vector. Unexpectedly, the hindwing regains aerodynamic performance near to that of the wing free from forewing wake interference, when the motion of the hindwing leads the forewing by around a quarter of the stroke cycle. This kinematic relationship between hind- and forewing closely matches the phase-shift commonly used by locusts and some dragonflies in climbing and forward flight. The experiments support previous assumptions that active neuromuscular control of fore- and hindwing stroke phase might enable dragonflies and other functionally four-winged insects to manipulate ipsilateral flight force production without further changes in wing beat kinematics.},

abstract = {We have examined the aerodynamic effects of corrugation in model insect wings that closely mimic the wing movements of hovering insects. Computational fluid dynamics were used with Reynolds numbers ranging from 35 to 3400, stroke amplitudes from 70 to 180 deg and mid-stroke angles of incidence from 15 to 60 deg. Various corrugated wing models were tested (care was taken to ensure that the corrugation introduced zero camber). The main results are as follows. At typical mid-stroke angles of incidence of hovering insects (35-50 deg), the time courses of the lift, drag, pitching moment and aerodynamic power coefficients of the corrugated wings are very close to those of the flat-plate wing, and compared with the flat-plate wing, the corrugation changes (decreases) the mean lift by less than 5{\%} and has almost no effect on the mean drag, the location of the center of pressure and the aerodynamic power required. A possible reason for the small aerodynamic effects of wing corrugation is that the wing operates at a large angle of incidence and the flow is separated: the large angle of incidence dominates the corrugation in determining the flow around the wing, and for separated flow, the flow is much less sensitive to wing shape variation. The present results show that for hovering insects, using a flat-plate wing to model the corrugated wing is a good approximation.},

abstract = {Of the insects that have been filmed in flight, those that are 1 mm in length or less often clap their wings together at the end of each upstroke and fling them apart at the beginning of each downstroke. This ;clap and fling' motion is thought to augment the lift forces generated during flight. What has not been highlighted in previous work is that very large forces are required to clap the wings together and to fling the wings apart at the low Reynolds numbers relevant to these tiny insects. In this paper, we use the immersed boundary method to simulate clap and fling in rigid and flexible wings. We find that the drag forces generated during fling with rigid wings can be up to 10 times larger than what would be produced without the effects of wing-wing interaction. As the horizontal components of the forces generated during the end of the upstroke and beginning of the downstroke cancel as a result of the motion of the two wings, these forces cannot be used to generate thrust. As a result, clap and fling appears to be rather inefficient for the smallest flying insects. We also add flexibility to the wings and find that the maximum drag force generated during the fling can be reduced by about 50{\%}. In some instances, the net lift forces generated are also improved relative to the rigid wing case.},

abstract = {We have used computational fluid dynamics to study changes in lift generation and vortex dynamics for Reynolds numbers (Re) between 8 and 128. The immersed boundary method was used to model a two-dimensional wing through one stroke cycle. We calculated lift and drag coefficients as a function of time and related changes in lift to the shedding or attachment of the leading and trailing edge vortices. We find that the fluid dynamics around the wing fall into two distinct patterns. For Re{\textgreater} or =64, leading and trailing edge vortices are alternately shed behind the wing, forming the von Karman vortex street. For Re{\textless} or =32, the leading and trailing edge vortices remain attached to the wing during each 'half stroke'. In three-dimensional studies, large lift forces are produced by 'vortical asymmetry' when the leading edge vortex remains attached to the wing for the duration of each half stroke and the trailing edge vortex is shed. Our two-dimensional study suggests that this asymmetry is lost for Re below some critical value (between 32 and 64), resulting in lower lift forces. We suggest that this transition in fluid dynamics is significant for lift generation in tiny insects.},

abstract = {Abstract Recently tightly coupled partitioned iterative methods have
drawn a great deal of attention due to easy implementation and encapsulation
features, and many nonlinear algorithms have been proposed so far.
However, their practical performances have not been well understood
yet. This paper describes the intensive parametric study on convergence
and stability performances of four kinds of nonlinear algorithms
with line-search techniques for partitioned iterative methods of
steady/unsteady fluid–structure interaction (FSI) problems. Here
we choose three typical FSI problems as test problems, i.e. (1) Collapsible
channel as a steady problem, (2) Cavity with flexible bottom membrane
and (3) Channel with flexible wall as unsteady problems. Efficiency
and robustness dependency of those nonlinear algorithms on physical
parameters such as degree of nonlinearity, added mass effect, time
step, and control parameters peculiar to each algorithm are clarified.
Through those tests, we demonstrate that the Line extrapolation method
and Broyden method with Backtrack line-search technique show good
performances in both stability and efficiency. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010

abstract = {Most hovering insects flap their wings in a horizontal plane (body having a large angle from the horizontal), called `normal hovering'. But some of the best hoverers, e.g. true hoverflies, hover with an inclined stroke plane (body being approximately horizontal). In the present paper, wing and body kinematics of four freely hovering true hoverflies were measured using three-dimensional high-speed video. The measured wing kinematics was used in a Navier-Stokes solver to compute the aerodynamic forces of the insects. The stroke amplitude of the hoverflies was relatively small, ranging from 65 to 85 deg, compared with that of normal hovering. The angle of attack in the downstroke (∼50 deg) was much larger that in the upstroke (∼20 deg), unlike normal-hovering insects, whose downstroke and upstroke angles of attack are not very different. The major part of the weight-supporting force (approximately 86{\%}) was produced in the downstroke and it was contributed by both the lift and the drag of the wing, unlike the normal-hovering case in which the weight-supporting force is approximately equally contributed by the two half-strokes and the lift principle is mainly used to produce the force. The mass-specific power was 38.59-46.3 and 27.5-35.4 W kg(-1) in the cases of 0 and 100{\%} elastic energy storage, respectively. Comparisons with previously published results of a normal-hovering true hoverfly and with results obtained by artificially making the insects' stroke planes horizontal show that for the true hoverflies, the power requirement for inclined stroke-plane hover is only a little ({\textless}10{\%}) larger than that of normal hovering.},

abstract = {Insect wings are compliant structures that experience deformations during flight. Such deformations have recently been shown to substantially affect induced flows, with appreciable consequences to flight forces. However, there are open questions related to the aerodynamic mechanisms underlying the performance benefits of wing deformation, as well as the extent to which such deformations are determined by the boundary conditions governing wing actuation together with mechanical properties of the wing itself. Here we explore aerodynamic performance parameters of compliant wings under periodic oscillations, subject to changes in phase between wing elevation and pitch, and magnitude and spatial pattern of wing flexural stiffness. We use a combination of computational structural mechanics models and a 2D computational fluid dynamics approach to ask how aerodynamic force production and control potential are affected by pitch/elevation phase and variations in wing flexural stiffness. Our results show that lift and thrust forces are highly sensitive to flexural stiffness distributions, with performance optima that lie in different phase regions. These results suggest a control strategy for both flying animals and engineering applications of micro-air vehicles.},

abstract = {Avoiding predators is an essential behavior in which animals must quickly transform sensory cues into evasive actions. Sensory reflexes are particularly fast in flying insects such as flies, but the means by which they evade aerial predators is not known. Using high-speed videography and automated tracking of flies in combination with aerodynamic measurements on flapping robots, we show that flying flies react to looming stimuli with directed banked turns. The maneuver consists of a rapid body rotation followed immediately by an active counter-rotation and is enacted by remarkably subtle changes in wing motion. These evasive maneuvers of flies are substantially faster than steering maneuvers measured previously and indicate the existence of sensory-motor circuitry that can reorient the fly's flight path within a few wingbeats.},

abstract = {Animals that travel together in groups display a variety of fascinating motion patterns thought to be the result of delicate local interactions among group members. Although the most informative way of investigating and interpreting collective movement phenomena would be afforded by the collection of high-resolution spatiotemporal data from moving individuals, such data are scarce and are virtually non-existent for long-distance group motion within a natural setting because of the associated technological difficulties. Here we present results of experiments in which track logs of homing pigeons flying in flocks of up to 10 individuals have been obtained by high-resolution lightweight GPS devices and analysed using a variety of correlation functions inspired by approaches common in statistical physics. We find a well-defined hierarchy among flock members from data concerning leading roles in pairwise interactions, defined on the basis of characteristic delay times between birds' directional choices. The average spatial position of a pigeon within the flock strongly correlates with its place in the hierarchy, and birds respond more quickly to conspecifics perceived primarily through the left eye-both results revealing differential roles for birds that assume different positions with respect to flock-mates. From an evolutionary perspective, our results suggest that hierarchical organization of group flight may be more efficient than an egalitarian one, at least for those flock sizes that permit regular pairwise interactions among group members, during which leader-follower relationships are consistently manifested.},

To prevent the steady state error induced by the boundary layer which is indispensable to avoid chattering phenomena, integral sliding mode function is introduced which achieves asymptotic convergence to the desired altitude with continuous control input.We verified the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control method through experiments of a RC small scale helicopter on hovering control near ground surface and external disturbance attenuation.},

At this speed the inclination of the stroke path is ca. 58 degrees to the horizontal, the stroke angle ca. 91 degrees, and the stroke frequency ca. 11-9 Hz. A method, based on steady-state aerodynamic and momenthum theories, is derived to calculate the lift and drag coefficients as averaged over the whole wing the whole wing-stroke for horizontal flapping flight. This is a further development of Pennycuick's (1968) and Weis-Fogh's (1972) expressions for calculating the lift coefficient. The lift coefficient obtained varies between 1-4 and 1-6, the drag coefficient between 0-4 and 1-2, and the lift:drag ratio between 1-2 and 4-0. The corresponding, calculated, total specific mechanical power output of the wing muscles varies between 27-0 and 40-4 W kg-1 body mass. A maximum estimate of mechanical efficiency is 0-26. The aerodynamic efficiency varies between 0-07 and 0-10. The force coefficient, total mechanical power output, and mechanical and aerodynamic efficiencies are all plausible, demonstrating that the slow flapping flight of Plecotus is thus explicable by steady-state aerodynamics. The downstroke is the power stroke for the vertical upward forces and the upstroke for the horizontal forward forces.},

Stability analyses and control algorithms are best applied to equations of motion in first-order form. This paper presents a method for approximating the first-order equations of motion for a flapping-wing micro air vehicle. The first-order equations of motion are derived from a coupled, multibody representation of the system. The first-order equations are analyzed using an approximation method called quarter-cycle averaging. The quarter-cycle averaging method is necessary because the classical averaging techniques are not available. The quarter-cycle approximation method is applied to representations of hovering flight and forward flight. The method enables the calculation of equilibrium points for the averaged system. For both flight regimes, the quarter-cycle approximatio method provides an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy when compared to local averaging.},

abstract = {Animal fliers frequently move through a variety of perturbed flows during their daily aerial routines. However, the extent to which these perturbations influence flight control and energetic expenditure is essentially unknown. Here, we evaluate the kinematic and metabolic consequences of flight within variably sized vortex shedding flows using five Anna's hummingbirds feeding from an artificial flower in steady control flow and within vortex wakes produced behind vertical cylinders. Tests were conducted at three horizontal airspeeds (3, 6 and 9 m s(-1)) and using three different wake-generating cylinders (with diameters equal to 38, 77 and 173{\%} of birds' wing length). Only minimal effects on wing and body kinematics were demonstrated for flight behind the smallest cylinder, whereas flight behind the medium-sized cylinder resulted in significant increases in the variances of wingbeat frequency, and variances of body orientation, especially at higher airspeeds. Metabolic rate was, however, unchanged relative to that of unperturbed flight. Hummingbirds flying within the vortex street behind the largest cylinder exhibited highest increases in variances of wingbeat frequency, and of body roll, pitch and yaw amplitudes at all measured airspeeds. Impressively, metabolic rate under this last condition increased by up to 25{\%} compared with control flights. Cylinder wakes sufficiently large to interact with both wings can thus strongly affect stability in flight, eliciting compensatory kinematic changes with a consequent increase in flight metabolic costs. Our findings suggest that vortical flows frequently encountered by aerial taxa in diverse environments may impose substantial energetic costs.},

abstract = {Shedding of vortices is a common phenomenon in the atmosphere over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, it is unclear how these vortices of varying scales affect the flight performance of flying animals. In order to examine these interactions, we trained seven hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) (wingspan {\~{}}9 cm) to fly and feed in a wind tunnel under steady flow (controls) and in the von K{\'{a}}rm{\'{a}}n vortex street of vertically oriented cylinders (two different cylinders with diameters of 10 and 5 cm) at speeds of 0.5, 1 and 2 m s(-1). Cylinders were placed at distances of 5, 25 and 100 cm upstream of the moths. Moths exhibited large amplitude yaw oscillations coupled with modest oscillations in roll and pitch, and slight increases in wingbeat frequency when flying in both the near (recirculating) and middle (vortex dominated) wake regions. Wingbeat amplitude did not vary among treatments, except at 1 m s(-1) for the large cylinder. Yaw and roll oscillations were synchronized with the vortex shedding frequencies in moths flying in the wake of the large cylinder at all speeds. In contrast, yaw and pitch were synchronized with the shedding frequency of small vortices at speeds ≤1 m s(-1). Oscillations in body orientation were also substantially smaller in the small cylinder treatment when compared with the large cylinder, regardless of temporal or non-dimensional spatial scale. Moths flying in steady conditions reached a higher air speed than those flying into cylinder wakes. In general, flight effects produced by the cylinder wakes were qualitatively similar among the recirculating and vortex-dominated wake regions; the magnitude of those effects, however, declined gradually with downstream distance.},

abstract = {Beavers are often found to be in conflict with human interests by creating nuisances like building dams on flowing water (leading to flooding), blocking irrigation canals, cutting down timbers, etc. At the same time they contribute to raising water tables, increased vegetation, etc. Consequently, maintaining an optimal beaver population is beneficial. Because of their diffusion externality (due to migratory nature), strategies based on lumped parameter models are often ineffective. Using a distributed parameter model for beaver population that accounts for their spatial and temporal behavior, an optimal control (trapping) strategy is presented in this paper that leads to a desired distribution of the animal density in a region in the long run. The optimal control solution presented, imbeds the solution for a large number of initial conditions (i.e., it has a feedback form), which is otherwise nontrivial to obtain. The solution obtained can be used in real-time by a nonexpert in control theory 
since it involves only using the neural networks trained offline. Proper orthogonal decomposition-based basis function design followed by their use in a Galerkin projection has been incorporated in the solution process as a model reduction technique. Optimal solutions are obtained through a ``single network adaptive critic'' (SNAC) neural-network architecture},

abstract = {Even though dynamic programming offers an optimal control solution in a state feedback form, the method is overwhelmed by computational and storage requirements. Approximate dynamic programming implemented with an Adaptive Critic (AC) neural network structure has evolved as a powerful alternative technique that obviates the need for excessive computations and storage requirements in solving optimal control problems. In this paper, an improvement to the AC architecture, called the ``Single Network Adaptive Critic (SNAC)'' is presented. This approach is applicable to a wide class of nonlinear systems where the optimal control (stationary) equation can be explicitly expressed in terms of the state and costate variables. The selection of this terminology is guided by the fact that it eliminates the use of one neural network (namely the action network) that is part of a typical dual network AC setup. As a consequence, the SNAC architecture offers three potential advantages: a simpler architecture, 
lesser computational load and elimination of the approximation error associated with the eliminated network. In order to demonstrate these benefits and the control synthesis technique using SNAC, two problems have been solved with the AC and SNAC approaches and their computational performances are compared. One of these problems is a real-life Micro-Electro-Mechanical-system (MEMS) problem, which demonstrates that the SNAC technique is applicable to complex engineering systems. {\&}copy; 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In the present study, we conduct an experiment using a one-paired dynamically scaled model of an insect wing, to investigate how asymmetric strokes with different wing kinematic parameters are used to control the aerodynamics of a dragonfly-like inclined flapping wing in still fluid. The kinematic parameters considered are the angles of attack during the mid-downstroke ($\alpha$(md)) and mid-upstroke ($\alpha$(mu)), and the duration ($\Delta$$\tau$) and time of initiation ($\tau$(p)) of the pitching rotation. The present dragonfly-like inclined flapping wing has the aerodynamic mechanism of unsteady force generation similar to those of other insect wings in a horizontal stroke plane, but the detailed effect of the wing kinematics on the force control is different due to the asymmetric use of the angle of attack during the up- and downstrokes. For example, high $\alpha$(md) and low $\alpha$(mu) produces larger vertical force with less aerodynamic power, and low $\alpha$(md) and high $\alpha$(mu) is recommended for horizontal force (thrust) production. The pitching rotation also affects the aerodynamics of a flapping wing, but its dynamic rotational effect is much weaker than the effect from the kinematic change in the angle of attack caused by the pitching rotation. Thus, the influences of the duration and timing of pitching rotation for the present inclined flapping wing are found to be very different from those for a horizontal flapping wing. That is, for the inclined flapping motion, the advanced and delayed rotations produce smaller vertical forces than the symmetric one and the effect of pitching duration is very small. On the other hand, for a specific range of pitching rotation timing, delayed rotation requires less aerodynamic power than the symmetric rotation. As for the horizontal force, delayed rotation with low $\alpha$(md) and high $\alpha$(mu) is recommended for long-duration flight owing to its high efficiency, and advanced rotation should be employed for hovering flight for nearly zero horizontal force. The present study suggests that manipulating the angle of attack during a flapping cycle is the most effective way to control the aerodynamic forces and corresponding power expenditure for a dragonfly-like inclined flapping wing.},

abstract = {The fluid dynamic analysis of animal wakes is becoming increasingly popular in studies of animal swimming and flying, due in part to the development of quantitative flow visualization techniques such as digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV). In most studies, quasi-steady flow is assumed and the flow analysis is based on velocity and/or vorticity fields measured at a single time instant during the stroke cycle. The assumption of quasi-steady flow leads to neglect of unsteady (time-dependent) wake vortex added-mass effects, which can contribute significantly to the instantaneous locomotive forces. In this paper we review a Lagrangian approach recently introduced to determine unsteady wake vortex structure by tracking the trajectories of individual fluid particles in the flow, rather than by analyzing the velocity/vorticity fields at fixed locations and single instants in time as in the Eulerian perspective. Once the momentum of the wake vortex and its added mass are determined, the corresponding unsteady locomotive forces can be quantified. Unlike previous studies that estimated the time-averaged forces over the stroke cycle, this approach enables study of how instantaneous locomotive forces evolve over time. The utility of this method for analyses of DPIV velocity measurements is explored, with the goal of demonstrating its applicability to data that are typically available to investigators studying animal swimming and flying. The methods are equally applicable to computational fluid dynamics studies where velocity field calculations are available.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a methodology for designing real-time controllers capable of enforcing desired trajectories on microrobotic insects in vertical flight and hovering. The main idea considered in this work is that altitude control can be translated into a problem of lift force control. Through analyses and experiments, we describe the proposed control strategy, which is fundamentally adaptive with some elements of model-based control. In order to test and explain the method for controller synthesis and tuning, a static single-wing flapping mechanism is employed in the collection of experimental data. The fundamental issues relating to the stability, performance, and stability robustness of the resulting controlled system are studied using the notion of an input-output linear time-invariant (LTI) equivalent system, which is a method for finding an internal model principle (IMP) based representation of the considered adaptive laws, using basic properties of the z-transform. Empirical results 
validate the suitability of the approach chosen for designing controllers and for analyzing their fundamental properties. {\&}copy; 1996-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional unsteady airfoil theory has a history that dates back at least 75 years. Closed-form solutions have been obtained for airfoil loads due to step response (either to a pitch input or to a gust), due to airfoil oscillations in the frequency domain, and due to generalized airfoil motions in the Laplace domain. It has also been shown that the response of airloads to airfoil motions can be formulated in state space in terms of ordinary differential equations that approximate the airfoil and flow field response. The more recent of these models are hierarchical in that the states represent inflow shape functions that form a convergent series in a Ritz-Galerkin sense. A comparison of the various approaches with each other and with alternative computational approaches yields insight into both the methodologies and the solutions. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper offers an integrated airloads-inflow model that is ideally suited for rotor aeroelasticity and control analysis, especially for cases in which eigenvalues are desired. The airloads model is derived from a rigorous application of thin-airfoil theory with an extension to allow for other airfoil effects, including ONERA type dynamic stall. The result is a hierarchical lift model that can be simplified down to any level including conventional 2-D strip theory. The inflow model is a complete 3-D representation of shed and trailing vorticity with a skewed cylindrical wake. The inflow is expanded in shape functions which can be truncated to any desired texture. Both models are written in closed-form state-variable equations with no hidden states and no integrals over the wake. The coupling between these models (and with any structural model) is effected through simple geometric relationships. The result is a unified rotor analysis in terms of ordinary differential equations for lift, inflow, and structure. ?? 1994.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional unsteady computations of the flow past a fruit fly Drosophila under hovering and free flight conditions are computed. The kinematics of the wings and the body of the fruit fly are prescribed from experimental observations. The computed unsteady lift and thrust forces are validated with experimental results and are in excellent agreement. The unsteady aerodynamic origin of the time-varying yaw moment is identified. The differences in the kinematics between the right and the left wings show that subtle change in the stroke angle and deviation angle can result in the yaw moment for the turning maneuver. The computed yaw moment reaches a peak value at the beginning of the maneuver and remains positive throughout the remainder of the maneuver. The origin of the yaw moment is investigated by computing the center of pressures on each wing and the individual moment arms. This investigation leads to the conclusion that it is the forward force and a component of the lift force that combine to produce the turning moment while the side force alone produces the restoring torque during the maneuver. The vorticity shed from the wing's leading edge and the tips show a loop like structure that during stroke reversals pinches off into Lambda-like structures that have not been previously observed in the wakes of flapping fliers.},

abstract = {Saving energy and enhancing performance are secular preoccupations shared by both nature and human beings. In animal locomotion, flapping flyers or swimmers rely on the flexibility of their wings or body to passively increase their efficiency using an appropriate cycle of storing and releasing elastic energy. Despite the convergence of many observations pointing out this feature, the underlying mechanisms explaining how the elastic nature of the wings is related to propulsive efficiency remain unclear. Here we use an experiment with a self-propelled simplified insect model allowing to show how wing compliance governs the performance of flapping flyers. Reducing the description of the flapping wing to a forced oscillator model, we pinpoint different nonlinear effects that can account for the observed behavior--in particular a set of cubic nonlinearities coming from the clamped-free beam equation used to model the wing and a quadratic damping term representing the fluid drag associated to the fast flapping motion. In contrast to what has been repeatedly suggested in the literature, we show that flapping flyers optimize their performance not by especially looking for resonance to achieve larger flapping amplitudes with less effort, but by tuning the temporal evolution of the wing shape (i.e., the phase dynamics in the oscillator model) to optimize the aerodynamics.},

abstract = {It is possible that micro air vehicle (MAV) designs of the future will exploit flapping flight to perform missions that require extreme agility, such as rapid flight beneath a forest canopy or within the confines of a building. Many of nature's most agile fliers generate flapping motions through resonant excitation of an aeroelastically tailored structure: muscle tissue is used to excite a vibratory mode of their flexible wing structure that creates propulsion and lift. A number of micro air vehicle concepts have been proposed that would operate in a similar fashion. An ongoing research activity is described in which mechanization and control concepts with application to resonant flapping MAVs are being explored. Structural approaches, mechanical design, sensing, and wingbeat control concepts inspired by hummingbirds, bats, and insects are examined. Experimental results from a testbed capable of generating vibratory wingbeat patterns that approximately match those exhibited by hummingbirds in 
hover, cruise, and reverse flight are presented.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel framework for the design, modeling and control of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV). The vehicle's conceptual design is based on biologically-inspired principles and emulates a dragonfly (Odonata-Anisoptera). We have taken inspiration from the flight mechanism features of the dragonfly and have developed indigenous designs in creating a novel version of a Flapping Wing MAV (FWMAV). The MAV design incorporates a complex mechanical construction and a sophisticated multi-layered, hybrid, linear/non-linear controller to achieve extended flight times and improved agility compared to other rotary wing and FWMAV Vertical Take Off and Landing (VTOL) designs. The first MAV prototype will have a ballpark weight including sensor payload of around 30 g. The targeted lifting capability is about twice the weight. The MAV features state of the art sensing and instrumentation payload, which includes integrated highpower on-board processors, 6DoF inertial sensors, 3DoF compasses, GPS, 
embedded camera and long-range telemetry capability. A 3-layer control mechanism has been developed to harness the dynamics and attain complete navigational control of the MAV. The inner-layer is composed of a 'quad hybrid-energy controller' and two higher layers are at present, implementing a linear controller; the latter will be replaced eventually with a dynamic adaptive non-linear controller. The advantages of the proposed design compared to other similar ones include higher energy efficiency and extended flight endurance. The design features elastic storage and re-use ofpropulsion energy favoring energy conservation during flight. The design/modeling of the MAV and its kinematics {\&} dynamics have been tested under simulation to achieve desired performance. The potential applications for such a high endurance vehicle are numerous, including air-deployable mass surveillance and reconnaissance in cluster and swarm formations. The efficacy of the design is demonstrated through a simulation environment. 
The dynamics are verified through simulations and a general linear controller coupled with an energy based non-linear controller is shown to operate the vehicle in a stable regime. In accordance with specified objectives a prototype is being developed for flight-testing and demonstration purposes. {\&}copy; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

The use of 3D printing technology has greatly expanded the possibilities for wing design, allowing wing shapes to replicate those of real insects or virtually any other shape. It has also reduced the time of a wing design cycle to a matter of minutes. An ornithopter with a mass of 3.89 g has been constructed using the 3D printing technique and has demonstrated an 85-s passively stable untethered hovering flight. This flight exhibits the functional utility of printed materials for flapping-wing experimentation and ornithopter construction and for understanding the mechanical principles underlying insect flight and control.},

The present paper deals with the development of simple control laws for an embedded implementation on a biomimetic MAV, aiming to control its attitude and position. The control laws are bounded, taking into consideration the amplitude bounds of the control angles characterizing the flapping wings movement. In order to validate the control laws, a simplified model having a simple wing kinematic parametrization and considering only the main aerodynamic forces and torques is proposed. The stability of the controller is shown in simulations using a diptera insect model. The robustness of the proposed controller is emphasized through different robustness tests. They concern mainly, model and aerodynamic parameters errors, and aim to validate the considered simplifications in the model. {\&}copy; 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Flying insects perform aerial maneuvers through slight manipulations of their wing motions. Because such manipulations in wing kinematics are subtle, a reliable method is needed to properly discern consistent kinematic strategies used by the insect from inconsistent variations and measurement error. Here, we introduce a novel automated method that accurately extracts full, 3D body and wing kinematics from high-resolution films of free-flying insects. This method combines visual hull reconstruction, principal components analysis, and geometric information about the insect to recover time series data of positions and orientations. The technique has small, well-characterized errors of under 3 pixels for positions and 5 deg. for orientations. To show its utility, we apply this motion tracking to the flight of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster. We find that fruit flies generate sideways forces during some maneuvers and that strong lateral acceleration is associated with differences between the left and right wing angles of attack. Remarkably, this asymmetry can be induced by simply altering the relative timing of flips between the right and left wings, and we observe that fruit flies employ timing differences as high as 10{\%} of a wing beat period while accelerating sideways at 40{\%} g.},

abstract = {The force evolution and associated vortex dynamics on a nominal two-dimensional tandem pitching and plunging configuration inspired by hovering dragonfly-like flight have been investigated experimentally using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The aerodynamic forces acting on the flat plates have been determined using a classic control-volume approach, i.e. a momentum balance. It was found that only the tandem phasing of $\psi$ = 90° was capable of generating similar levels of thrust when compared to the single-plate reference case. For this tandem configuration, however, a much more constant thrust generation was developed over the cycle. Further examination showed that the force and vortex development on the fore-plate was unaffected by the tandem configuration and that nearly all variations in performance could be attributed to the vortex interaction on the hind-plate. By calculating the trajectory and strength of the hind-plate's trailing-edge vortex, the chain-like vortex interaction mechanism responsible for improved performance at $\psi$ = 90° could be identified. The underlying result from this study suggests that the dominant vortex interaction in dragonfly flight is two dimensional and that the spanwise flow generated by root-flapping kinematics is not entirely necessary for efficient propulsion but potentially due to evolutionary restrictions in nature.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation (LES) is employed to investigate the use of plasma-based actuation for the control of a vortical gust interacting with a wing section at a low Reynolds number. Flow about the SD7003 airfoil section at 4 degrees angle of attack and a chord-based Reynolds number of 60,000 is considered in the simulation, which typifies micro air vehicle (MAV) applications. Solutions are obtained to the Navier-Stokes equations that were augmented by source terms used to represent body forces imparted by the plasma actuator on the fluid. A simple phenomenological model provided these body forces resulting from the electric field generated by the plasma. The numerical method is based upon a high-fidelity time-implicit scheme and an implicit LES approach which are used to obtain solutions on a locally refined overset mesh system. A Taylor-like vortex model is employed to represent a gust impinging upon the wing surface, which causes a substantial disruption to the undisturbed flow. It is shown that the fundamental impact of the gust on unsteady aerodynamic forces is due to an inviscid process, corresponding to variation in the effective angle of attack, which is not easily overcome. Plasma control is utilised to mitigate adverse effects of the interaction and improve aerodynamic performance. Physical characteristics of the interaction are described, and several aspects of the control strategy are explored. Among these are uniform and non-uniform spanwise variations of the control configuration, co-flow and counter-flow orientations of the directed force, pulsed and continuous operations of the actuator and strength of the plasma field. Results of the control situations are compared with regard to their effect upon aerodynamic forces. It was found that disturbances to the moment coefficient produced by the gust can be greatly reduced, which may be significant for stability and handling of MAV operations.},

abstract = {Unsteady water flows are common in nature, yet the swimming performance of fishes is typically evaluated at constant, steady speeds in the laboratory. We examined how cyclic changes in water flow velocity affect the swimming performance and energetics of a labriform swimmer, the shiner surfperch, Cymatogaster aggregata. Using intermittent-flow respirometry, we measured critical swimming speed (Ucrit), oxygen consumption rate (O2) and pectoral fin use in steady flow versus unsteady flows with either low (0.5 body lengths per second; BLs(-1)) or high amplitude (1.0 BLs(-1)) velocity fluctuations, with a 5 s period. Individuals in low amplitude unsteady flow performed as well as fish in steady flow. However, swimming costs in high amplitude unsteady flow were on average 25.3 {\%} higher than in steady flow and 14.2{\%} higher than estimated values obtained from simulations based on the non-linear relationship between swimming speed and oxygen consumption rate in steady flow. Time-averaged pectoral fin use (fin beat frequency measured over 300 s) was similar among treatments. However, measures of instantaneous fin use (fin beat period) and body movement in high amplitude unsteady flow indicate that individuals with greater variation in the duration of their fin beats were better at holding station and consumed less oxygen than fish with low variation in fin beat period. These results suggest that the costs of swimming in unsteady flows are context dependent in labriform swimmers, and may be influenced by individual differences in the ability of fishes to adjust their fin beats to the flow environment.},

@article{Sane2002,
abstract = {We used a dynamically scaled model insect to measure the rotational forces produced by a flapping insect wing. A steadily translating wing was rotated at a range of constant angular velocities, and the resulting aerodynamic forces were measured using a sensor attached to the base of the wing. These instantaneous forces were compared with quasi-steady estimates based on translational force coefficients. Because translational and rotational velocities were constant, the wing inertia was negligible, and any difference between measured forces and estimates based on translational force coefficients could be attributed to the aerodynamic effects of wing rotation. By factoring out the geometry and kinematics of the wings from the rotational forces, we determined rotational force coefficients for a range of angular velocities and different axes of rotation. The measured coefficients were compared with a mathematical model developed for two-dimensional motions in inviscid fluids, which we adapted to the three-dimensional case using blade element theory. As predicted by theory, the rotational coefficient varied linearly with the position of the rotational axis for all angular velocities measured. The coefficient also, however, varied with angular velocity, in contrast to theoretical predictions. Using the measured rotational coefficients, we modified a standard quasi-steady model of insect flight to include rotational forces, translational forces and the added mass inertia. The revised model predicts the time course of force generation for several different patterns of flapping kinematics more accurately than a model based solely on translational force coefficients. By subtracting the improved quasi-steady estimates from the measured forces, we isolated the aerodynamic forces due to wake capture.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of reinforcement learning in a dynamically changing environment. In this context, we study the problem of adaptive control of finite-state Markov chains with a finite number of controls. The transition and payoff structures are unknown. The objective is to find an optimal policy which maximizes the expected total discounted payoff over the infinite horizon. A stochastic neural network model is suggested for the controller. The parameters of the neural net, which determine a random control strategy, are updated at each instant using a simple learning scheme. This learning scheme involves estimation of some relevant parameters using an adaptive critic. It is proved that the controller asymptotically chooses an optimal action in each state of the Markov chain with a high probability.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore controllability in flapping fight for Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), inch-size robots capable of autonomous fight. Differently from previous work, we focus on a MAV with very limited wing kinematics and simple input control schemes. In particular, in the first part we show how an MAV provided with a pair of wings, each with a single degree of freedom and passive rotation, can still ensure controllability. This is obtained by combining two ideas. The first idea is to parameterize wing trajectory based on biomimetic principles, i.e. principles that are directly inspired by observation of real insect fight The second idea is to treat flapping fight within the framework of high frequency control and to apply averaging theory arguments in order to prove controllability. The results obtained set flapping fight as a compelling example of high frequency control present in nature, and shed light on some of the reasons of superior maneuverability observed in flapping fight. Then, in 
the second part we show that controllability is still guaranteed even when the wing-thorax dynamics is included and the electromechanical structure is driven by a pulse width modulation (PWM) scheme where only its amplitude, period and duty cycle are controllable on a wingbeat-by-wingbeat basis. However, in this case our modeling clearly shows some tradeoffs between controllability and lift generation efficiency, which seem consistent with observations in real insect fight.},

@article{Sefati2013,
abstract = {A surprising feature of animal locomotion is that organisms typically produce substantial forces in directions other than what is necessary to move the animal through its environment, such as perpendicular to, or counter to, the direction of travel. The effect of these forces has been difficult to observe because they are often mutually opposing and therefore cancel out. Indeed, it is likely that these forces do not contribute directly to movement but may serve an equally important role: to simplify and enhance the control of locomotion. To test this hypothesis, we examined a well-suited model system, the glass knifefish Eigenmannia virescens, which produces mutually opposing forces during a hovering behavior that is analogous to a hummingbird feeding from a moving flower. Our results and analyses, which include kinematic data from the fish, a mathematical model of its swimming dynamics, and experiments with a biomimetic robot, demonstrate that the production and differential control of mutually opposing forces is a strategy that generates passive stabilization while simultaneously enhancing maneuverability. Mutually opposing forces during locomotion are widespread across animal taxa, and these results indicate that such forces can eliminate the tradeoff between stability and maneuverability, thereby simplifying neural control.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to clarify the effects of structural flexibility of wings of a butterfly in flapping flight. For this purpose, a dynamics model of a butterfly is derived by Lagrange's method, where the butterfly is considered as a rigid multi-body system. The panel method is employed to simulate the flow field and the aerodynamic forces acting on the wings. The mathematical model is validated by the agreement of the numerical result with the experimentally measured data. Then, periodic orbits of flapping-of-wings flights are parametrically searched in order to fly the butterfly models. Almost periodic orbits are found, but they are unstable. Deformation of the wings is modeled in two ways. One is bending and its effect on the aerodynamic forces is discussed. The other is passive wing torsion caused by structural flexibility. Numerical simulations demonstrate that flexible torsion reduces the flight instability.},

abstract = {Color patterns play central roles in the behavior of insects, and are important traits for taxonomic studies. Here we report striking and stable structural color patterns--wing interference patterns (WIPs)--in the transparent wings of small Hymenoptera and Diptera, patterns that have been largely overlooked by biologists. These extremely thin wings reflect vivid color patterns caused by thin film interference. The visibility of these patterns is affected by the way the insects display their wings against various backgrounds with different light properties. The specific color sequence displayed lacks pure red and matches the color vision of most insects, strongly suggesting that the biological significance of WIPs lies in visual signaling. Taxon-specific color patterns are formed by uneven membrane thickness, pigmentation, venation, and hair placement. The optically refracted pattern is also stabilized by microstructures of the wing such as membrane corrugations and spherical cell structures that reinforce the pattern and make it essentially noniridescent over a large range of light incidences. WIPs can be applied to map the micromorphology of wings through direct observation and are useful in several fields of biology. We demonstrate their usefulness as identification patterns to solve cases of cryptic species complexes in tiny parasitic wasps, and indicate their potentials for research on the genetic control of wing development through direct links between the transregulatory wing landscape and interference patterns we observe in Drosophila model species. Some species display sexually dimorphic WIPs, suggesting sexual selection as one of the driving forces for their evolution.},

abstract = {A novel reinforcement-learning based output-adaptive neural network (NN) controller, also referred as the adaptive-critic NN controller, is developed to track a desired trajectory for a class of complex nonlinear discrete-time systems in the presence of bounded and unknown disturbances. The controller includes an observer for estimating states and the outputs, critic, and two action NNs for generating virtual, and actual control inputs. The critic approximates certain strategic utility function and the action NNs are used to minimize both the strategic utility function and their outputs. All NN weights adapt online towards minimization of a performance index, utilizing gradient-descent based rule. A Lyapunov function proves the uniformly ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the closed-loop tracking error, weight, and observer estimation. Separation principle and certainty equivalence principles are relaxed; persistency of excitation condition and linear in the unknown parameter assumption is not needed. 
The performance of this controller is evaluated on a spark ignition (SI) engine operating with high exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) levels and experimental results are demonstrated. {\&}copy;2007 IEEE.},

abstract = {Low Reynolds number aerodynamics is important to a number of natural and man-made flyers. Birds, bats, and insects have been of interest to biologists for years, and active study in the aerospace engineering community, motivated by interest in micro air vehicles (MAVs), has been increasing rapidly. The primary focus of this book is the aerodynamics associated with fixed and flapping wings. The book consider both biological flyers and MAVs, including a summary of the scaling laws-which relate the aerodynamics and flight characteristics to a flyer's sizing on the basis of simple geometric and dynamics analyses, structural flexibility, laminar-turbulent transition, airfoil shapes, and unsteady flapping wing aerodynamics. The interplay between flapping kinematics and key dimensionless parameters such as the Reynolds number, Strouhal number, and reduced frequency is highlighted. The various unsteady lift enhancement mechanisms are also addressed, including leading-edge vortex, rapid pitch-up and rotational circulation, wake capture, and clap-and-fling.},

The method uses a staggered storage arrangement for the pressure and velocity variables and adopts an edge-based data structure and assembly procedure which is valid for arbitrary n-sided polygonal meshes. Edge formulas are presented for assembling the ALE form of the momentum and pressure equations. An implicit multi-stage time integrator is constructed that is geometrically conservative to the precision of the arithmetic used in the computation. The method is shown to be second-order-accurate in time and space for general time-dependent polygonal meshes. The method is first evaluated using several well-known unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes problems before being applied to a periodically forced aeroelastic problem and a transient free surface problem.

abstract = {Bird flight occurs over a range of Reynolds numbers (Re; 10(4) {\textless} or = Re {\textless} or = 10(5), where Re is a measure of the relative importance of inertia and viscosity) that includes regimes where standard aerofoil performance is difficult to predict, compute or measure, with large performance jumps in response to small changes in geometry or environmental conditions. A comparison of measurements of fixed wing performance as a function of Re, combined with quantitative flow visualisation techniques, shows that, surprisingly, wakes of flapping bird wings at moderate flight speeds admit to certain simplifications where their basic properties can be understood through quasi-steady analysis. Indeed, a commonly cited measure of the relative flapping frequency, or wake unsteadiness, the Strouhal number, is seen to be approximately constant in accordance with a simple requirement for maintaining a moderate local angle of attack on the wing. Together, the measurements imply a fine control of boundary layer separation on the wings, with implications for control strategies and wing shape selection by natural and artificial fliers.},

abstract = {Flying insects generate forces that are too large to be accounted for by conventional steady-state aerodynamics. To investigate these mechanisms of force generation, we trained red admiral butterflies, Vanessa atalanta, to fly freely to and from artificial flowers in a wind tunnel, and used high-resolution, smoke-wire flow visualizations to obtain qualitative, high-speed digital images of the air flow around their wings. The images show that free-flying butterflies use a variety of unconventional aerodynamic mechanisms to generate force: wake capture, two different types of leading-edge vortex, active and inactive upstrokes, in addition to the use of rotational mechanisms and the Weis-Fogh 'clap-and-fling' mechanism. Free-flying butterflies often used different aerodynamic mechanisms in successive strokes. There seems to be no one 'key' to insect flight, instead insects rely on a wide array of aerodynamic mechanisms to take off, manoeuvre, maintain steady flight, and for landing.},

abstract = {With detailed measurements of flight-related morphological parameters of 18 species within the tribe Heliconiini and 10 of their non-heliconiine comimics, I found that morphological parameters relevant to flight biomechanics are associated with three escape tactics of these Neotropical butterflies: evasive flight, distastefulness, and mimicry. Two distinct character suites, one pertaining to the position of centre of body mass and another pertaining to wing shape, were identified using principal-components analysis. A third component correlated most highly with the position of centre of wing mass. Mimicry groups were best discriminated by the positions of centres of body and wing mass, suggesting that these features converged within mimicry groups. Centres of mass were positioned nearer to the wing base in mimicry groups composed of more palatable species, presumably decreasing the radial moments of inertia of the body and wings and increasing flight speed and turning performance. Predation has selected for body morphology that increases flight speed and manoeuvrability in palatable butterflies, whereas the morphology of distasteful species compromises flight performance. Convergent selection may reduce morphological differences of species within mimicry groups arising from distantly related lineages, and hence it may have enhanced the morphological diversification of palatable and unpalatable butterflies within lineages that have more recently evolved distastefulness.},

abstract = {In the wet forests of Panama, El Ni{\~{n}}o typically brings a more prolonged and severe dry season. Interestingly, many trees and lianas that comprise the wet forests increase their productivity as a response to El Ni{\~{n}}o. Here, we quantify the abundance of migrating Marpesia chiron butterflies over 17 yr and the production of new leaves of their hostplants over 9 yr to test the generality of the El Ni{\~{n}}o migration syndrome, i.e., whether increased abundance of migrating insects and productivity of their food plants are associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events. We find that the quantity of M. chiron migrating across the Panama Canal was directly proportional to the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly of the Pacific Ocean, which characterizes El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a events. We also find that production of new leaves by its larval host trees, namely Brosimum alicastrum, Artocarpus altilis, and Ficus citrifolia, was directly proportional to the SST anomaly, with greater leaf flushing occurring during the period of the annual butterfly migration that followed an El Ni{\~{n}}o event. Combining these and our previously published results for the migratory butterfly Aphrissa statira and its host lianas, we conclude that dry season rainfall and photosynthetically active radiation can serve as primary drivers of larval food production and insect population outbreaks in Neotropical wet forests, with drier years resulting in enhanced plant productivity and herbivore abundance. Insect populations should closely track changes in both frequency and amplitude of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation with climate change.},

Relative to distasteful species, palatable butterﬂies ﬂy faster and maneuver  more successfully to evade attacks from aerial predators. The large thorax and short  abdomen of palatable species position the center of body mass near to the wing base,  whereas the mass allocation and body shape of distasteful butterﬂies position center of  body mass further posteriorly.

abstract = {1. Thousands of records of migratory butterfly species such as Vanessa cardui flying just above ground-level on fixed compass bearings have led to the common belief that these insects migrate within the so-called 'flight-boundary layer', where movements are relatively independent of the wind. 2. Given the selective advantages of windborne migration and the existence of a number of observations of flights of V. cardui from the upper levels of the atmosphere, we tested the hypothesis that migration from North Africa to southern Europe in this species is influenced by synoptic-scale wind currents. 3. Even with modern technology, it is extremely difficult to observe high-altitude flights directly, so we rely on an indirect approach that examines whether or not arrival peaks in north-eastern Spain are associated with winds blowing from Africa. 4. Arrivals of V. cardui were determined for the spring period (1 March-27 June, 1997-2006) at 79 sites in the Catalan Butterfly Monitoring Scheme. Wind patterns were described on the basis of synoptic-scale maps, transport models and back-trajectories calculated for each day of the spring period. 5. We found a strong association between migration and winds from North Africa, both for the whole data set (1997-2006; chi(2) = 4.7, P = 0.03) and for a restricted data set that excludes years in which the species was very scarce (chi(2) = 7.26, P = 0.007). 6. Episodes of massive northward migration within the species' flight-boundary layer also coincided with spells of winds from North Africa, suggesting a connection between low-altitude (observational) and high-altitude flights (inferred from wind patterns). 7. Finally, on the assumption that migration in V. cardui is windborne, a source-receptor transport model applied to spring abundance data in north-eastern Spain enables us to identify the most probable population source areas in North Africa.},

abstract = {This paper discusses a methodology of analyzing the flight dynamic stability of a flapping wing Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) in hover. The flexible flapping wings are modeled by a strain-based geometrically nonlinear beam formulation, coupled with an empirical aerodynamic formulation for load calculation on the wings surfaces. Wing flapping kinematics is described using a set of Euler angles. Nonlinear equations of motion for the body frame attached to the vehicle are used to complete the coupled aeroelastic and flight dynamic formulation. All these formulations are implemented in an integrated numerical framework. To evaluate the flight dynamic stability of the hovering flapping wing MAV, the coupled nonlinear governing equations are linearized, and the transition matrix over a wing flapping cycle is determined. By taking advantage of the periodic hovering condition, the stability analysis is performed based on the transition matrix in the Floquet theory. Longitudinal and lateral stabilities of a 
flapping wing MAV in hover is explored with the impact of different wing rigidity and inertia. Copyright {\&}copy; 2011 by Weihua Su and Carlos E. S. Cesnik.},

abstract = {Aerodynamic force generation and mechanical power requirements of a dragonfly (Aeschna juncea) in hovering flight are studied. The method of numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations in moving overset grids is used. When the midstroke angles of attack in the downstroke and the upstroke are set to 52 degrees and 8 degrees, respectively (these values are close to those observed), the mean vertical force equals the insect weight, and the mean thrust is approximately zero. There are two large vertical force peaks in one flapping cycle. One is in the first half of the cycle, which is mainly due to the hindwings in their downstroke; the other is in the second half of the cycle, which is mainly due to the forewings in their downstroke. Hovering with a large stroke plane angle (52 degrees ), the dragonfly uses drag as a major source for its weight-supporting force (approximately 65{\%} of the total vertical force is contributed by the drag and 35{\%} by the lift of the wings). The vertical force coefficient of a wing is twice as large as the quasi-steady value. The interaction between the fore- and hindwings is not very strong and is detrimental to the vertical force generation. Compared with the case of a single wing in the same motion, the interaction effect reduces the vertical forces on the fore- and hindwings by 14{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively, of that of the corresponding single wing. The large vertical force is due to the unsteady flow effects. The mechanism of the unsteady force is that in each downstroke of the hindwing or the forewing, a new vortex ring containing downward momentum is generated, giving an upward force. The body-mass-specific power is 37 W kg(-1), which is mainly contributed by the aerodynamic power.},

abstract = {A computational fluid-dynamic analysis was conducted to study the unsteady aerodynamics of a model fruit fly wing. The wing performs an idealized flapping motion that emulates the wing motion of a fruit fly in normal hovering flight. The Navier-Stokes equations are solved numerically. The solution provides the flow and pressure fields, from which the aerodynamic forces and vorticity wake structure are obtained. Insights into the unsteady aerodynamic force generation process are gained from the force and flow-structure information. Considerable lift can be produced when the majority of the wing rotation is conducted near the end of a stroke or wing rotation precedes stroke reversal (rotation advanced), and the mean lift coefficient can be more than twice the quasi-steady value. Three mechanisms are responsible for the large lift: the rapid acceleration of the wing at the beginning of a stroke, the absence of stall during the stroke and the fast pitching-up rotation of the wing near the end of the stroke. When half the wing rotation is conducted near the end of a stroke and half at the beginning of the next stroke (symmetrical rotation), the lift at the beginning and near the end of a stroke becomes smaller because the effects of the first and third mechanisms above are reduced. The mean lift coefficient is smaller than that of the rotation-advanced case, but is still 80 {\%} larger than the quasi-steady value. When the majority of the rotation is delayed until the beginning of the next stroke (rotation delayed), the lift at the beginning and near the end of a stroke becomes very small or even negative because the effect of the first mechanism above is cancelled and the third mechanism does not apply in this case.

abstract = {The longitudinal stabilization control of a hovering model insect was studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the stability and control derivatives, and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis and modal decomposition, for solving the equations of motion (morphological and certain kinematical data of hoverflies were used for the model insect). The model insect has the same three natural modes of motion as those reported recently for a hovering bumblebee: one unstable oscillatory mode, one stable fast subsidence mode and one stable slow subsidence mode. Controllability analysis shows that although unstable, the flight is controllable. For stable hovering, the unstable oscillatory mode needs to be stabilized and the slow subsidence mode needs stability augmentation. The former can be accomplished by feeding back pitch attitude, pitch rate and horizontal velocity to produce delta[symbol: see text] or deltaalpha(2); the latter by feeding back vertical velocity to produce deltaPhi or deltaalpha(1) (deltaPhi, delta[symbol: see text], deltaalpha(1) and deltaalpha(2) denote control inputs: deltaPhi and delta[symbol: see text] represent changes in stroke amplitude and mean stroke angle, respectively; deltaalpha(1) represents an equal change whilst deltaalpha(2) a differential change in the geometrical angles of attack of the downstroke and upstroke).},

abstract = {The effect of wing corrugation on torsional deformation was investigated for dragonfly wings. Wing corrugation dramatically increases the warping rigidity, without significantly increasing the torsional rigidity. This behavior implies that the warping moment, which is proportional to the warping rigidity, has a larger resistance against the external moment than does the torsional moment by Saint-Venant's theory, which is proportional to the torsional rigidity. The larger warping rigidity means the wing can be thinner, provided the maximum deformation is restricted. Such a thinner, lighter wing is more suitable for beating flight because such wings have better aerodynamic performance and require lower inertial power.

We measured the natural frequencies of the torsional deformation of four species of dragonflies. In all cases, the lowest natural frequency of the torsional deformation was over two times higher than the beating frequency. This means that resonance does not significantly increase the passive torsional deformation caused by the flapping motion. The natural frequencies of the torsional deformation of dragonflies are determined by the warping rigidity, which is increased by the wing corrugation. The corrugation prevents unusually large deformation induced by resonance of the wing.},

The unsteady lift due to arbitrary wing motion is generated using the static lift curve. Then, state-space representation for the unsteady lift is derived. The proposed model is validated through a comparison with direct numerical simulations of Navier-Stokes on hovering insects. A comparison with quasi-steady models that capture the LEV contribution is also performed to assess the role of unsteadiness. Similarly, a comparison with classical unsteady approaches is presented to assess the LEV dominance. Finally, a reduced-order model that is more suitable for flight dynamics and control analyses is derived from the full model. ?? 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

abstract = {In this paper, we show an approach to elucidate the free flight of an insect using a simulation. We modeled a fly, Drosophila, by using aerodynamics, body dynamics, and control theory. The modeled virtual insect performs free flight in virtual space generated by a computer. We simulated the free flight of a virtual insect having two dimensions and two degrees of freedom. The flight pass and flight velocity of the virtual insect during a free flight were calculated by Newton's equations of motion. The aerodynamic force generated by the flapping motion of the virtual insect was estimated by using the blade element theory. An optimal regulator theory was used as a control law. The flight pass from the initial position to the target position and the wing motion was obtained from the results of the free flight simulation of the virtual insect. We can presume the wing motion of an insect in free flight by using the flight simulation of a virtual insect. These results have suggested that the approach 
based on the simulation is effective in elucidating the free flight of an insect. Copyright {\&}copy; 2006 by The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract = {Unlike other flying insects, the wing motion of swallowtail butterflies is basically limited to flapping because their fore wings partly overlap their hind wings, structurally restricting the feathering needed for active control of aerodynamic force. Hence, it can be hypothesized that the flight of swallowtail butterflies is realized with simple flapping, requiring little feedback control of the feathering angle. To verify this hypothesis, we fabricated an artificial butterfly mimicking the wing motion and wing shape of a swallowtail butterfly and analyzed its flights using images taken with a high-speed video camera. The results demonstrated that stable forward flight could be realized without active feathering or feedback control of the wing motion. During the flights, the artificial butterfly's body moved up and down passively in synchronization with the flapping, and the artificial butterfly followed an undulating flight trajectory like an actual swallowtail butterfly. Without feedback control of the wing motion, the body movement is directly affected by change of aerodynamic force due to the wing deformation; the degree of deformation was determined by the wing venation. Unlike a veinless wing, a mimic wing with veins generated a much higher lift coefficient during the flapping flight than in a steady flow due to the large body motion.},

abstract = {The effect of wing flexibility in hoverflies was investigated using an at-scale mechanical model. Unlike dynamically-scaled models, an at-scale model can include all phenomena related to motion and deformation of the wing during flapping. For this purpose, an at-scale polymer wing mimicking a hoverfly was fabricated using a custom micromolding process. The wing has venation and corrugation profiles which mimic those of a hoverfly wing and the measured flexural stiffness of the artificial wing is comparable to that of the natural wing. To emulate the torsional flexibility at the wing-body joint, a discrete flexure hinge was created. A range of flexure stiffnesses was chosen to match the torsional stiffness of pronation and supination in a hoverfly wing. The polymer wing was compared with a rigid, flat, carbon-fiber wing using a flapping mechanism driven by a piezoelectric actuator. Both wings exhibited passive rotation around the wing hinge; however, these rotations were reduced in the case of the compliant polymer wing due to chordwise deformations during flapping which caused a reduced effective angle of attack. Maximum lift was achieved when the stiffness of the hinge was similar to that of a hoverfly in both wing cases and the magnitude of measured lift is sufficient for hovering; the maximum lift achieved by the single polymer and carbon-fiber wings was 5.9 × 10(2)( )$\mu$N and 6.9 × 10(2)( )$\mu$N, respectively. These results suggest that hoverflies could exploit intrinsic compliances to generate desired motions of the wing and that, for the same flapping motions, a rigid wing could be more suitable for producing large lift.},

The Reynolds number investigated ranges from 75 to 1700, and the reduced frequency from 0.36 to 2.0. Two flapping modes are studied, namely, the water-treading hovering mode, and the normal hovering mode. Although the delayed-stall mechanism is found to be responsible for generating the maximum lift peaks in both hovering modes, the wake-capturing mechanism is identified only in the normal hovering mode. In addition to the strong role played by the kinematics, the Reynolds number's role has also been clearly identified. In the low Reynolds number regime, 0(100), the viscosity dissipates the vortex structures quickly and leads to essentially symmetric How structure and aerodynamics force between the forward stroke and backward strokes. At higher Reynolds numbers (300 and larger), the history effect is influential, resulting in distinctly asymmetric phenomena between the forward and backward strokes.},

abstract = {The numerical simulation of an insect-sized 'X-wing' type biplane flapping wing configuration is performed in 3D using an immersed boundary method solver at Reynolds numbers equal to 1000 (1 k) and 5 k, based on the wing's root chord length. This X-wing type flapping configuration draws its inspiration from Delfly, a bio-inspired ornithopter MAV which has two pairs of wings flapping in anti-phase in a biplane configuration. The objective of the present investigation is to assess the aerodynamic performance when the original Delfly flapping wing micro-aerial vehicle (FMAV) is reduced to the size of an insect. Results show that the X-wing configuration gives more than twice the average thrust compared with only flapping the upper pair of wings of the X-wing. However, the X-wing's average thrust is only 40{\%} that of the upper wing flapping at twice the stroke angle. Despite this, the increased stability which results from the smaller lift and moment variation of the X-wing configuration makes it more suited for sharp image capture and recognition. These advantages make the X-wing configuration an attractive alternative design for insect-sized FMAVS compared to the single wing configuration. In the Reynolds number comparison, the vorticity iso-surface plot at a Reynolds number of 5 k revealed smaller, finer vortical structures compared to the simulation at 1 k, due to vortices' breakup. In comparison, the force output difference is much smaller between Re = 1 k and 5 k. Increasing the body inclination angle generates a uniform leading edge vortex instead of a conical one along the wingspan, giving higher lift. Understanding the force variation as the body inclination angle increases will allow FMAV designers to optimize the thrust and lift ratio for higher efficiency under different operational requirements. Lastly, increasing the spanwise flexibility of the wings increases the thrust slightly but decreases the efficiency. The thrust result is similar to one of the spanwise studies, but the efficiency result contradicts it, indicating that other flapping parameters are involved as well. Results from this study provide a deeper understanding of the underlying aerodynamics of the X-wing type, which will help to improve the performance of insect-sized FMAVs using this unique configuration.},

We first outline some general principles of flapping flight dynamics, before presenting a framework for modelling insect flight dynamics using empirical data from real insects. Using wind tunnel and rotary balance measurements to measure time-invariant stability/control derivatives and their time-periodic equivalents, we formulate linear time-invariant (LTI) and nonlinear time-periodic (NLTP) equations of motion describing the longitudinal flight dynamics of desert locusts. We use these models to formulate a practical definition of stability in flapping flight and discuss consequences for flapping flight control in terms of limit cycle control and periodic gain scheduling. We conclude by considering possible implications for flapping wing MAV design.},

abstract = {Here we provide the first formal quantitative analysis of dynamic stability in a flying animal. By measuring the longitudinal static stability derivatives and mass distribution of desert locusts Schistocerca gregaria, we find that their static stability and static control responses are insufficient to provide asymptotic longitudinal dynamic stability unless they are sensitive to pitch attitude (measured with respect to an inertial or earth-fixed frame) as well as aerodynamic incidence (measured relative to the direction of flight). We find no evidence for a 'constant-lift reaction', previously supposed to keep lift production constant over a range of body angles, and show that such a reaction would be inconsequential because locusts can potentially correct for pitch disturbances within a single wingbeat. The static stability derivatives identify three natural longitudinal modes of motion: one stable subsidence mode, one unstable divergence mode, and one stable oscillatory mode (which is present with or without pitch attitude control). The latter is identified with the short period mode of aircraft, and shown to consist of rapid pitch oscillations with negligible changes in forward speed. The frequency of the short period mode (approx. 10 Hz) is only half the wingbeat frequency (approx. 22 Hz), so the mode would become coupled with the flapping cycle without adequate damping. Pitch rate damping is shown to be highly effective for this purpose - especially at the small scales associated with insect flight - and may be essential in stabilising locust flight. Although having a short period mode frequency close to the wingbeat frequency risks coupling, it is essential for control inputs made at the level of a single wingbeat to be effective. This is identified as a general constraint on flight control in flying animals.},

abstract = {(1) Fifteen-point profiles of aerial density in relation to height up to 32 m were measured for twenty-four insect taxa. (2) All profiles showed a discontinuity. (3) This discontinuity occurred at a height of 30 cm for total insects, where mean-wind speed matched mean flight-speed. (4) Flight behaviour above the discontinuity was much more consistent than below. (5) Above the discontinuity, log density X log height regression coefficients conformed with expectation based on known behaviour, size, and upward atmospheric transport. (6) The discontinuity thus agrees with expectation from the boundary layer hypothesis. (7) The proportion of small insects above the boundary layer is significantly correlated with the diurnal flight periodicity of the taxon.},

@article{Templin2000,
abstract = {This paper summarizes available data on the geometry and flight characteristics of all types of winged animals, including insects, gliders, birds, bats and pterosaurs. Helicopter momentum stream tube theory has been adapted for the estimation of the upper size limits for flying animals in gliding, hovering, solitary and formation flight, and also of performance quantities such as minimum, cruising and maximum steady airspeeds, manoeuvrability and the energy cost of transport. The stream tube theory can be criticized as an over-simplification of the complex flow fields of flapping-wing flight, but overall agreement with known animal flight characteristics is found to be generally good. The theory suggests that many flight performance quantities depend mainly on only two parameters: the animal mass and wing span. This allows the design of a two-dimensional chart in which each flying animal has a location, and in which contours of size limits and performance quantities may be cross-plotted. Flight simulation, based on the momentum theory, has been used to explore the take-off flight of hypothetical proto-flyers from ground and from perches. The results favour the `trees down' rather than `ground up' theory of vertebrate flight origins.},

abstract = {We present serial and parallel algorithms for solving a system of equations that arises from the discretization of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation associated to a trajectory optimization problem of the following type. A vehicle starts at a prespecified point x{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and follows a unit speed trajectory x(t) inside a region in R{\textless}sup{\textgreater}m{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, until an unspecified time T that the region is exited. A trajectory minimizing a cost function of the form {\&}int;{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}T{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} r(x(t)) dt + q(x(T)) is sought. The discretized Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to this problem is usually solved using iterative methods. Nevertheless, assuming that the function r is positive, we are able to exploit the problem structure and develop one-pass algorithms for the discretized problem. The first algorithm resembles Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and runs in time O(n log n), where n is the number of grid points. The second algorithm uses a somewhat different discretization and borrows some ideas from 
a variation of Dial's shortest path algorithm that we develop here; it runs in time O(n), which is the best possible, under some fairly mild assumptions. Finally, we show that the latter algorithm can be efficiently parallelized: for two-dimensional problems and with p processors, its running time becomes O(n/p), provided that p = O({\&}radic;n/log n).},

abstract = {Of the 17 muscles responsible for flight control in flies, only the first basalar muscle (b1) is known to fire an action potential each and every wing beat at a precise phase of the wing-beat period. The phase of action potentials in the b1 is shifted during turns, implicating the b1 in the control of aerodynamic yaw torque. We used the work loop technique to quantify the effects of phase modulation on the mechanical output of the b1 of the blowfly Calliphora vicina. During cyclic length oscillations at 10 and 50 Hz, the magnitude of positive work output by the b1 was similar to that measured previously from other insect muscles. However, when tested at wing-beat frequency (150 Hz), the net work performed in each cycle was negative. The twitch kinetics of the b1 suggest that negative work output reflects intrinsic specializations of the b1 muscle. Our results suggest that, in addition to a possible role as a passive elastic element, the phase-sensitivity of its mechanical properties may endow the b1 with the capacity to modulate wing-beat kinematics during turning maneuvers.},

@article{Tytell2010,
abstract = {In fishes the shape of the body and the swimming mode generally are correlated. Slender-bodied fishes such as eels, lampreys, and many sharks tend to swim in the anguilliform mode, in which much of the body undulates at high amplitude. Fishes with broad tails and a narrow caudal peduncle, in contrast, tend to swim in the carangiform mode, in which the tail undulates at high amplitude. Such fishes also tend to have different wake structures. Carangiform swimmers generally produce two staggered vortices per tail beat and a strong downstream jet, while anguilliform swimmers produce a more complex wake, containing at least two pairs of vortices per tail beat and relatively little downstream flow. Are these differences a result of the different swimming modes or of the different body shapes, or both? Disentangling the functional roles requires a multipronged approach, using experiments on live fishes as well as computational simulations and physical models. We present experimental results from swimming eels (anguilliform), bluegill sunfish (carangiform), and rainbow trout (subcarangiform) that demonstrate differences in the wakes and in swimming performance. The swimming of mackerel and lamprey was also simulated computationally with realistic body shapes and both swimming modes: the normal carangiform mackerel and anguilliform lamprey, then an anguilliform mackerel and carangiform lamprey. The gross structure of simulated wakes (single versus double vortex row) depended strongly on Strouhal number, while body shape influenced the complexity of the vortex row, and the swimming mode had the weakest effect. Performance was affected even by small differences in the wakes: both experimental and computational results indicate that anguilliform swimmers are more efficient at lower swimming speeds, while carangiform swimmers are more efficient at high speed. At high Reynolds number, the lamprey-shaped swimmer produced a more complex wake than the mackerel-shaped swimmer, similar to the experimental results. Finally, we show results from a simple physical model of a flapping fin, using fins of different flexural stiffness. When actuated in the same way, fins of different stiffnesses propel themselves at different speeds with different kinematics. Future experimental and computational work will need to consider the mechanisms underlying production of the anguilliform and carangiform swimming modes, because anguilliform swimmers tend to be less stiff, in general, than are carangiform swimmers.},

@article{Usherwood2002,
abstract = {Recent work on flapping hawkmoth models has demonstrated the importance of a spiral 'leading-edge vortex' created by dynamic stall, and maintained by some aspect of spanwise flow, for creating the lift required during flight. This study uses propeller models to investigate further the forces acting on model hawkmoth wings in 'propeller-like' rotation ('revolution'). Steadily revolving model hawkmoth wings produce high vertical ( approximately lift) and horizontal ( approximately profile drag) force coefficients because of the presence of a leading-edge vortex. Both horizontal and vertical forces, at relevant angles of attack, are dominated by the pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces; separation at the leading edge prevents 'leading-edge suction'. This allows a simple geometric relationship between vertical and horizontal forces and the geometric angle of attack to be derived for thin, flat wings. Force coefficients are remarkably unaffected by considerable variations in leading-edge detail, twist and camber. Traditional accounts of the adaptive functions of twist and camber are based on conventional attached-flow aerodynamics and are not supported. Attempts to derive conventional profile drag and lift coefficients from 'steady' propeller coefficients are relatively successful for angles of incidence up to 50 degrees and, hence, for the angles normally applicable to insect flight.},

abstract = {This paper presents an improved Adaptive-Reinforcement Learning Control methodology for the problem of unmanned air vehicle morphing control. The reinforcement learning morphing control function that learns the optimal shape change policy is integrated with an adaptive dynamic inversion control trajectory tracking function. An episodic unsupervised learning simulation using the Q-learning method is developed to replace an earlier and less accurate Actor-Critic algorithm. Sequential Function Approximation, a Galerkin-based scattered data approximation scheme, replaces a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method and is used to generalize the learning from previously experienced quantized states and actions to the continuous state-action space, all of which may not have been experienced before. The improved method showed smaller errors and improved learning of the optimal shape compared to the KNN. {\&}copy; 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Insects are attractive models for the development of micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) due to their relatively simple sensing, actuation and control architectures as compared to vertebrates, and because of their robust flight ability in dynamic and heterogeneous environments, characterized by turbulence and gusts of wind. How do insects respond to gust perturbations? We investigated this question by perturbing freely-flying honey bees and stalk-eye flies with low-pressure bursts of compressed air to simulate a wind gust. Body and wing kinematics were analyzed from flight sequences, recorded using three high-speed digital video cameras. Bees quickly responded to body rotations caused by gusts through bilateral asymmetry in stroke amplitude, whereas stalk-eye flies used a combination of asymmetric stroke amplitude and wing rotation angle. Both insects coordinated asymmetric and symmetric kinematics in response to gusts, which provides model strategies for simple yet robust flight characteristics for MAVs.},

@article{vanella2009,
abstract = {In the present study, a computational investigation was carried out to understand the influence of flexibility on the aerodynamic performance of a hovering wing. A flexible, two-dimensional, two-link model moving within a viscous fluid was considered. The Navier-Stokes equations governing the fluid dynamics were solved together with the equations governing the structural dynamics by using a strongly coupled fluid-structure interaction scheme. Harmonic kinematics was used to prescribe the motions of one of the links, thus effectively reducing the wing to a single degree-of-freedom oscillator. The wing's flexibility was characterized by the ratio of the flapping frequency to the natural frequency of the structure. Apart from the rigid case, different values of this frequency ratio (only in the range of 1/2 to 1/6) were considered at the Reynolds numbers of 75, 250 and 1000. It was found that flexibility can enhance aerodynamic performance and that the best performance is realized when the wing is excited by a non-linear resonance at 1/3 of the natural frequency. Specifically, at Reynolds numbers of 75, 250 and 1000, the aerodynamic performance that is characterized by the ratio of lift coefficient to drag coefficient is respectively increased by 28{\%}, 23{\%} and 21{\%} when compared with the corresponding ratios of a rigid wing driven with the same kinematics. For all Reynolds numbers, the lift generated per unit driving power is also enhanced in a similar manner. The wake capture mechanism is enhanced, due to a stronger flow around the wing at stroke reversal, resulting from a stronger end of stroke vortex at the trailing edge. The present study provides some clues about how flexibility affects the aerodynamic performance in low Reynolds number flapping flight. In addition, it points to the importance of considering non-linear resonances for enhancing aerodynamic performance.},

@article{Vargas2008,
abstract = {A comprehensive computational fluid-dynamics-based study of a pleated wing section based on the wing of Aeshna cyanea has been performed at ultra-low Reynolds numbers corresponding to the gliding flight of these dragonflies. In addition to the pleated wing, simulations have also been carried out for its smoothed counterpart (called the 'profiled' airfoil) and a flat plate in order to better understand the aerodynamic performance of the pleated wing. The simulations employ a sharp interface Cartesian-grid-based immersed boundary method, and a detailed critical assessment of the computed results was performed giving a high measure of confidence in the fidelity of the current simulations. The simulations demonstrate that the pleated airfoil produces comparable and at times higher lift than the profiled airfoil, with a drag comparable to that of its profiled counterpart. The higher lift and moderate drag associated with the pleated airfoil lead to an aerodynamic performance that is at least equivalent to and sometimes better than the profiled airfoil. The primary cause for the reduction in the overall drag of the pleated airfoil is the negative shear drag produced by the recirculation zones which form within the pleats. The current numerical simulations therefore clearly demonstrate that the pleated wing is an ingenious design of nature, which at times surpasses the aerodynamic performance of a more conventional smooth airfoil as well as that of a flat plate. For this reason, the pleated airfoil is an excellent candidate for a fixed wing micro-aerial vehicle design.},

This leading edge also had a Krueger-type flap, which served as a protective shield against insect impacts. The second leading edge had suction through a slotted titanium skin with 27 spanwise slots (about 0.004 in. wide) on the upper and lower surfaces to maintain laminar flow on both surfaces to the front spar. Fluid dispensed through some of these slots near the attachment line provided wing-surface wetting to protect against insect impacts. Both leading edges were equipped with anti-icing and fluid-purge systems.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question, do the rotational forces in the hovering fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster reflect something different (the Magnus effect) or more of the same (circulatory-and-attached-vortex force)? The results of an unsteady blade-element model using empirically derived force coefficients from translating (root-oscillating) wings are compared with recent results derived from both the measured forces on a dynamically scaled Drosophila wing and the computational fluid dynamic (CFD)-modeled forces on a virtual Drosophila wing. The behavior of the forces in all three models during wing rotation supports the hypothesis that rotational lift is not a novel aerodynamic mechanism but is caused by the same fluid-dynamic mechanism that occurs during wing translation. A comparison of the unsteady model with a quasi-steady model that employs empirically derived rotational coefficients further supports the hypothesis that rotational forces are more of the same. Finally, the overall similarity of the results between the unsteady model, the physical wing model and the CFD model suggests that the unsteady model can be used to explore the performance consequences of kinematic variation and to investigate locomotor control in freely moving animals.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed analysis of the deforming wing kinematics of free-flying hoverflies (Eristalis tenax, Linnaeus) during hovering flight. We used four high-speed digital video cameras to reconstruct the motion of approximately 22 points on each wing using photogrammetric techniques. While the root-flapping motion of the wing is similar in both the downstroke and upstroke, and is well modelled as a simple harmonic motion, other wing kinematic parameters show substantial variation between the downstroke and upstroke. Whereas the magnitude of the angle of incidence varies considerably within and between different hoverflies, the twist distribution along the wing is highly stereotyped. The angle of incidence and camber both show a recoil effect as they change abruptly at stroke reversal. Pronation occurs consistently after stroke reversal, which is perhaps surprising, because this has been found to reduce lift production in modelling studies. We find that the alula, a hinged flap near the base of the wing, operates in two discrete states: either in plane with the wing, or flipped approximately normal to it. We hypothesize that the alula may be acting as a flow-control device.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed analysis of the wing kinematics and wing deformations of desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria, Forsk{\aa}l) flying tethered in a wind tunnel. We filmed them using four high-speed digital video cameras, and used photogrammetry to reconstruct the motion of more than 100 identified points. Whereas the hindwing motions were highly stereotyped, the forewing motions showed considerable variation, consistent with a role in flight control. Both wings were positively cambered on the downstroke. The hindwing was cambered through an 'umbrella effect' whereby the trailing edge tension compressed the radial veins during the downstroke. Hindwing camber was reversed on the upstroke as the wing fan corrugated, reducing the projected area by 30 per cent, and releasing the tension in the trailing edge. Both the wings were strongly twisted from the root to the tip. The linear decrease in incidence along the hindwing on the downstroke precisely counteracts the linear increase in the angle of attack that would otherwise occur in root flapping for an untwisted wing. The consequent near-constant angle of attack is reminiscent of the optimum for a propeller of constant aerofoil section, wherein a linear twist distribution allows each section to operate at the unique angle of attack maximizing the lift to drag ratio. This implies tuning of the structural, morphological and kinematic parameters of the hindwing for efficient aerodynamic force production.},

We filmed tethered locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) and free-flying hoverflies (Eristalis tenax) using four high-speed digital video cameras. We digitized multiple natural features and marked points on the wings using manual and automated tracking. Epipolar geometry was used to identify additional points on the hoverfly wing outline which were anatomically indistinguishable. The cameras were calibrated using a bundle adjustment technique that provides an estimate of the error associated with each individual data point. The mean absolute three-dimensional measurement error was 0.11 mm for the locust and 0.03 mm for the hoverfly. The error in the angle of incidence was at worst 0.51 degrees (s.d.) for the locust and 0.88 degrees (s.d.) for the hoverfly. The results we present are of unprecedented spatio-temporal resolution, and represent the most detailed measurements of insect wing kinematics to date. Variable spanwise twist and camber are prominent in the wingbeats of both the species, and are of such complexity that they would not be adequately captured by lower resolution techniques. The role of spanwise twist and camber in insect flight has yet to be fully understood, and accurate insect wing kinematics such as we present here are required to be sure of making valid predictions about their aerodynamic effects.},

For ADP algorithms, the point of focus is that iterative algorithms of ADP can be sorted into two classes: one class is the iterative algorithm with initial stable policy; the other is the one without the requirement of initial stable policy. It is generally believed that the latter one has less computation at the cost of missing the guarantee of system stability during iteration process. In addition, many recent papers have provided convergence analysis associated with the algorithms developed. Furthermore, we point out some topics for future studies. {\&}copy; 2006 Non IEEE.},

abstract = {Each year, millions of monarch butterflies from eastern North America migrate to overwinter in 10-13 discrete colonies located in the Oyamel forests of central Mexico. For decades efforts to track monarch migration have relied on observations and tag-recapture methods, culminating with the discovery of the wintering colonies in 1975. Monarch tag returns from Mexico, however, are few and primarily from two accessible colonies, and therefore tag-recapture techniques have not quantified natal origins or distinctiveness among monarch populations at wintering sites. Such information would be invaluable in the conservation of the monarch and its migration phenomenon since the wintering sites currently are threatened by habitat alteration. Here we show that stable hydrogen (deltaD) and carbon (delta13C) isotope ratios of wintering monarchs can be used to evaluate natal origins on the summer breeding range. Stable-hydrogen and carbon isotopic values of 597 wintering monarchs from 13 wintering roost sites were compared with isotopic patterns measured in individuals at natal sites across their breeding range over a single migration cycle. We determined that all monarch wintering colonies were composed of individuals originating mainly from the Midwest, United States, thereby providing evidence for a panmictic model of wintering colony composition. However, two colonies showed more northerly origins, suggesting possible priority colonies for conservation efforts.},

Turbulence intensity was varied from 1.2 to 12.6{\%} and the longitudinal integral length scale was varied from 0.17 to 1.21m. The overall trend when the intensity was increased was to reduce the lift curve slope but increase the maximum lift coefficient. When the length scale was increased and the intensity was held nominally constant, the lift curve slope increased and the maximum lift coefficient reduced. The largest variation in lift with increasing intensity was found at between 5 and 10 degrees where a reduction in lift of up to 28{\%} was found. Spectograms of the pressure fluctuations gave insight into the behavior of the laminar separation bubble under the influence of turbulence.},

abstract = {The aerodynamic mechanisms employed durng the flight of the hawkmoth, Manduca sexta, have been investigated through smoke visualization studies with tethered moths. Details of the flow around the wings and of the overall wake structure were recorded as stereophotographs and high-speed video sequences. The changes in flow which accompanied increases in flight speed from 0.4 to 5.7 m s-1 were analysed. The wake consists of an alternating series of horizontal and vertical vortex rings which are generated by successive down- and upstrokes, respectively. The downstroke produces significantly more lift than the upstroke due to a leading-edge vortex which is stabilized by a radia flow moving out towards the wingtip. The leading-edge vortex grew in size with increasing forward flight velocity. Such a phenomenon is proposed as a likely mechanism for lift enhancement in many insect groups. During supination, vorticity is shed from the leading edge as postulated in the 'flex' mechanism. This vorticity would enhance upstroke lift if it was recaptured diring subsequent translation, but it is not. Instead, the vorticity is left behind and the upstroke circulation builds up slowly. A small jet provides additional thrust as the trailing edges approach at the end of the upstroke. The stereophotographs also suggest that the bound circulation may not be reversed between half strokes at the fastest flight speeds.},

abstract = {Insect wings are mounted on hinges, restricting the extent to which their bases can be supinated for the upstroke. The forewings of many insects therefore include devices that allow the distal part of the wing to twist relative to the base under aerodynamic loading in the upstroke, but restrict such twisting in the downstroke where the effect would be detrimental. In the broad forewings of butterflies, this asymmetric resistance to aerodynamic twisting seems to be a consequence of the curved section of the leading edge. The wing can be modelled as a cantilevered, thin cambered plate. Torsional tests on the forewings of four butterfly species and on a paper wing of curved section confirm the effect. Differences between the results for the four species appear to fit their morphological and kinematic differences. The nature of the mechanism is outlined.},

This factor is crucial in understanding their complex, extremely varied morphology. Models have proved particularly useful in clarifying the facilitation and control of wing deformation. Their development has followed a logical sequence from conceptual models through physical and simple analytical to numerical models. All have value provided their limitations are realized and constant comparisons made with the properties and mechanical behaviour of real wings. Numerical modelling by the finite element method is by far the most time-consuming approach, but has real potential in analysing the adaptive significance of structural details and interpreting evolutionary trends. Published examples are used to review the strengths and weaknesses of each category of model, and a summary is given of new work using finite element modelling to investigate the vibration properties and response to impact of hawkmoth wings.},

abstract = {A pressure-based method is presented for discretizing the unsteady incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using hybrid unstructured meshes. The edge-based data structure and assembly procedure adopted lead naturally to a strictly conservative discretization, which is valid for meshes composed of n-sided polygons. Particular attention is given to the construction of a pressure–velocity coupling procedure which is supported by edge data, resulting in a relatively simple numerical method that is consistent with the boundary and initial conditions required by the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. Edge formulas are presented for assembling the momentum equations, which are based on an upwind-biased linear reconstruction of the velocity field. Similar formulas are presented for assembling the pressure equation. The method is demonstrated to be second-order accurate in space and time for two Navier–Stokes problems admitting an exact solution. Results for several other well-known problems are also presented, including lid-driven cavity flow, impulsively started cylinder flow, and unsteady vortex shedding from a circular cylinder. Although the method is by construction minimalist, it is shown to be accurate and robust for the problems considered.},

abstract = {Flapping wing flight as seen in hummingbirds and insects poses an interesting unsteady aerodynamic problem: coupling of wing kinematics, structural dynamics and aerodynamics. There have been numerous studies on the kinematics and aerodynamics in both experimental and computational cases with both natural and artificial wings. These studies tend to ignore wing flexibility; however, observation in nature affirms that passive wing deformation is predominant and may be crucial to the aerodynamic performance. This paper presents a multidisciplinary experimental endeavor in correlating a flapping micro air vehicle wing's aeroelasticity and thrust production, by quantifying and comparing overall thrust, structural deformation and airflow of six pairs of hummingbird-shaped membrane wings of different properties. The results show that for a specific spatial distribution of flexibility, there is an effective frequency range in thrust production. The wing deformation at the thrust-productive frequencies indicates the importance of flexibility: both bending and twisting motion can interact with aerodynamic loads to enhance wing performance under certain conditions, such as the deformation phase and amplitude. By measuring structural deformations under the same aerodynamic conditions, beneficial effects of passive wing deformation can be observed from the visualized airflow and averaged thrust. The measurements and their presentation enable observation and understanding of the required structural properties for a thrust effective flapping wing. The intended passive responses of the different wings follow a particular pattern in correlation to their aerodynamic performance. Consequently, both the experimental technique and data analysis method can lead to further studies to determine the design principles for micro air vehicle flapping wings.},

A 1-D distributed parameter model of a fin is developed from basic thermal physics principles. {\&}ldquo;Snapshot{\&}rdquo; solutions of the dynamics are generated with a simple dynamic inversion-based feedback controller. Empirical basis functions are designed using the {\&}ldquo;proper orthogonal decomposition{\&}rdquo; (POD) technique and the snapshot solutions. A low-order nonlinear lumped parameter system to characterize the infinite dimensional system is obtained by carrying out a Galerkin projection. An ADP-based neurocontroller with a dual heuristic programming (DHP) formulation is obtained with a single-network-adaptive-critic (SNAC) controller for this approximate nonlinear model. Actual control in the original domain is calculated with the same POD basis functions through a reverse mapping. Further contribution of this paper 
includes development of an online robust neurocontroller to account for unmodeled dynamics and parametric uncertainties inherent in such a complex dynamic system. A neural network (NN) weight update rule that guarantees boundedness of the weights and relaxes the need for persistence of excitation (PE) condition is presented. Simulation studies show that in a fairly extensive but compact domain, any desired temperature profile can be achieved starting from any initial temperature profile. Therefore, the ADP and NN-based controllers appear to have the potential to become controller synthesis tools for nonlinear distributed parameter systems.},

This paper proposes an atomic force microscope (AFM) based force controller to push nano particles on the substrates. A block phase correlation-based algorithm is embedded into the controller for the compensation of the thermal drift which is considered as the main external uncertainty during nanomanipulation. Then, the interactive forces and dynamics between the tip and the particle, particle and the substrate are modeled and analyzed. Further, an adaptive critic NN controller based on adaptive dynamic programming algorithm is designed and the task of pushing nano particles is demonstrated. This adaptive critic NN position/force controller utilizes a single NN in order to approximate the cost functional and subsequently the optimal control input is calculated. Finally, the convergence of the states, NN weight estimates and force errors are shown. {\&}copy; 2006 IEEE.},

abstract = {A nonaffine discrete-time system represented by the nonlinear autoregressive moving average with eXogenous input (NARMAX) representation with unknown nonlinear system dynamics is considered. An equivalent affinelike representation in terms of the tracking error dynamics is first obtained from the original nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time system so that reinforcement-learning-based near-optimal neural network (NN) controller can be developed. The control scheme consists of two linearly parameterized NNs. One NN is designated as the critic NN, which approximates a predefined long-term cost function, and an action NN is employed to derive a near-optimal control signal for the system to track a desired trajectory while minimizing the cost function simultaneously. The NN weights are tuned online. By using the standard Lyapunov approach, the stability of the closed-loop system is shown. The net result is a supervised actor-critic NN controller scheme which can be applied to a general nonaffine 
nonlinear discrete-time system without needing the affinelike representation. Simulation results demonstrate satisfactory performance of the controller. {\&}copy; 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Forward flights of a bilaterally symmetrically flapping butterfly modeled as a four-link rigid-body system consisting of a thorax, an abdomen, and left and right wings are numerically simulated. The joint motions of the butterflies are adopted from experimental observations. Three kinds of the simulations, distinguished by ways to determine the position and attitude of the thorax, are carried out: a tethered simulation, a prescribed simulation, and free-flight simulations. The upward and streamwise forces as well as the wake structures in the tethered simulation, where the thorax of the butterfly is fixed, reasonably agree with those in the corresponding tethered experiment. In the prescribed simulation, where the thoracic trajectories as well as the joint angles are given by those observed in a free-flight experiment, it is confirmed that the butterfly can produce enough forces to achieve the flapping flights. Moreover, coherent vortical structures in the wake and those on the wings are identified. The generation of the aerodynamic forces due to the vortical structures are also clarified. In the free-flight simulation, where only the joint angles are given as periodic functions of time, it is found that the free flight is longitudinally unstable because the butterfly cannot maintain the attitude in a proper range. Focusing on the abdominal mass, which largely varies owing to feeding and metabolizing, we have shown that the abdominal motion plays an important role in periodic flights. The necessity of control of the thoracic attitude for periodic flights and maneuverability is also discussed.},

abstract = {The present study numerically investigates the effect of the wavy leading edge on hydrodynamic characteristics for the flow of rectangular wings with the low aspect ratio of 1.5 at one Reynolds number of 106 based on free stream velocity and the chord length C. The waviness ratio Rw is defined by the span length of wing to the spanwise length covered by the waviness. Five different waviness ratios of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 at fixed wavelength of 0.2C and wavy amplitude of 0.025C have been considered. The smooth wing and Rw = 0.2 revealed the similar variation of lift coefficient CL according to the angle of attack $\alpha$, resulting in the same stall angle of 20°, where the maximum lift appears. The case of Rw = 0.6 presented the earliest occurrence of the stall at $\alpha$ = 12°. The cases of Rw = 1.0, 0.8 and 0.4 produced the same stall angle of $\alpha$ = 16°. In the post-stall region, CL for Rw = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 recovered and became larger than those of the smooth wing and Rw = 0.2. A spiral formation of the limiting streamlines occurred in the wavy troughs, which derive relatively low pressure along the leading edge.},

abstract = {A theoretical modeling approach as well as an unsteady analytical method is used to study aerodynamic characteristics of wing flapping with asymmetric stroke-cycles in connection with an oblique stroke plane during insect forward flight. It is revealed that the aerodynamic asymmetry between the downstroke and the upstroke due to stroke-asymmetrical flapping is a key to understand the flow physics of generation and modulation of the lift and the thrust. Predicted results for examples of given kinematics validate more specifically some viewpoints that the wing lift is more easily produced when the forward speed is higher and the thrust is harder, and the lift and the thrust are generated mainly during downstroke and upstroke, respectively. The effects of three controlling parameters, i.e. the angles of tilted stroke plane, the different downstroke duration ratios, and the different angles of attack in both down- and up-stroke, are further discussed. It is found that larger oblique angles of stroke 
planes generate larger thrust but smaller lift; larger downstroke duration ratios lead to larger thrust, while making little change in lift and input aerodynamic power; and again, a small increase of the angle of attack in downstroke or upstroke may cause remarkable changes in aerodynamic performance in the relevant stroke.},

abstract = {Available knowledge of insect flight suggests that two-winged flies implement a feedback control paradigm not exploited in engineering and have remarkable performance, achieved in a computationally simple way. This sensor-rich feedback control paradigm relies on extensive, distributed measurement of the quantities of interest in space and time. From an engineering point of view, this paradigm suggests that there is no need for high-resolution imaging cameras for flight control based on optic flow. Instead, coarse-grained arrays of sensors could give good results provided they are arranged to offer a global view of the environment, endowed with parallel processing for extraction of the global vector field of motion via several, overlapping patches of the field, and characterized by sensitivities dependent on the direction of motion.},

abstract = {We discuss some aspects of mathematical modelling relevant to the dynamics of insect flight in the context of insect-like flapping-wing micro air vehicles (MAVs). MAVs are small flying vehicles developed to reconno{\^{i}}tre in confined spaces. This requires power-efficient, highly-manoeuvrable, low-speed flight with stable hover. All of these attributes are present in insect flight and hence the focus on reproducing the functionality of insect flight by engineering means. Empirical research on insect flight dynamics is limited by experimental difficulties. Force and moment measurements require tethering the animal whose behaviour may then differ from free flight. The measurements are made when the insect actively tries to control its flight, so that its open-loop dynamics cannot be observed. Finally, investigation of the sensory-motor system responsible for flight is even more challenging. Despite these difficulties, much empirical progress has been made recently. Further progress, especially in the context of MAVs, can be achieved by the complementary information derived from appropriate mathematical modelling. The focus here is on a means of computing the data not easily available from experiments and also on making mathematical predictions to suggest new experiments. We consider two aspects of mathematical modelling for insect flight dynamics. The first one is theoretical (computational), as opposed to empirical, generation of the aerodynamic data required for the six-degrees-of-freedom equations of motion. For this purpose we first explain insect wing kinematics and the salient features of the corresponding flow. In this context, we show that aerodynamic modelling is a feasible option for certain flight regimes, focusing on a successful example of modelling hover. Such modelling progresses from the first principles of fluid mechanics, but relies on simplifications justified by the known flow phenomenology and/or geometric and kinematic symmetries. This is relevant to six types of fundamental manoeuvres, which we define as those flight conditions for which only one component of the translational and rotational body velocities is nonzero and constant. The second aspect of mathematical modelling for insect flight dynamics addressed here deals with the periodic character of the aerodynamic force and moment production. This leads to consideration of the types of solutions of nonlinear equations forced by nonlinear oscillations. In particular, the mechanism of synchronization seems relevant and should be investigated further.},

abstract = {The dynamics of swimming fish and flapping flags involves a complicated interaction of their deformable shapes with the surrounding fluid flow. Even in the passive case of a flag, the flag exerts forces on the fluid through its own inertia and elastic responses, and is likewise acted on by hydrodynamic pressure and drag. But such couplings are not well understood. Here we study these interactions experimentally, using an analogous system of flexible filaments in flowing soap films. We find that, for a single filament (or 'flag') held at its upstream end and otherwise unconstrained, there are two distinct, stable dynamical states. The first is a stretched-straight state: the filament is immobile and aligned in the flow direction. The existence of this state seems to refute the common belief that a flag is always unstable and will flap. The second is a flapping state: the filament executes a sinuous motion in a manner akin to the flapping of a flag in the wind. We study further the hydrodynamically coupled interaction between two such filaments, and demonstrate the existence of four different dynamical states.},

abstract = {The lateral dynamic flight stability of a hovering model insect (dronefly)was studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the stability derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis for solving the equations of motion. The main results are as following. (i) Three natural modes of motion were identified: one unstable slow divergence mode (mode 1), one stable slow oscillatory mode (mode 2), and one stable fast subsidence mode (mode 3). Modes 1 and 2 mainly consist of a rotation about the horizontal longitudinal axis (x-axis) and a side translation; mode 3 mainly consists of a rotation about the x-axis and a rotation about the vertical axis. (ii) Approximate analytical expressions of the eigenvalues are derived, which give physical insight into the genesis of the natural modes of motion. (iii) For the unstable divergence mode, td, the time for initial disturbances to double, is about 9 times the wingbeat period (the longitudinal motion of the model insect was shown to be also unstable and td of the longitudinal unstable mode is about 14 times the wingbeat period). Thus, although the flight is not dynamically stable, the instability does not grow very fast and the insect has enough time to control its wing motion to suppress the disturbances.},

abstract = {The assembly modes of dragonfly wings are observed through FEG-ESEM. Different from airplane wings, dragonfly wings are found to be assembled through smooth transition mode and global package mode. First, at the vein/membrane conjunctive site, the membrane is divided into upper and lower portions from the center layer and transited smoothly to the vein. Then the two portions pack the vein around and form the outer surface of the vein. Second, at the vein/spike conjunctive site, the vein and spike are connected smoothly into a triplet. Last, at the vein/membrane/spike conjunctive site, the membrane (i.e., the outer layer of the vein) transits smoothly to the spike, packs it around, and forms its outer layer. In short, the membrane looks like a closed coat packing the wing as a whole. The smooth transition mode and the global package mode are universal assembly modes in dragonfly wings. They provide us the references for better understanding of the functions of dragonfly wings and the bionic manufactures of the wings of flights with mini sizes.},

abstract = {We investigated inertial and aerodynamic power consumption during hovering flight of the hawk moth Manduca sexta. The aerodynamic power was estimated based on the aerodynamic forces and torques measured on model hawk-moth wings and hovering kinematics. The inertial power was estimated based on the measured wing mass distribution and hovering kinematics. The results suggest that wing inertial power (without consideration of muscle efficiency and elastic energy storage) consumes about half of the total power expenditure. Wing areal mass density was measured to decrease sharply from the leading edge toward the trailing edge and from the wing base to the wing tip. Such a structural property helps to minimize the wing moment of inertia given a fixed amount of mass. We measured the aerodynamic forces on the rigid and flexible wings, which were made to approximate the flexural stiffness (EI) distribution and deformation of moth wings. It has been found that wings with the characteristic spanwise and chordwise decreasing EI (and mass density) are beneficial for power efficiency while generating aerodynamic forces comparative to rigid wings. Furthermore, negative work to aid pitching in stroke reversals from aerodynamic forces was found, and it showed that the aerodynamic force contributes partially to passive pitching of the wing.},

abstract = {Recent work on the aerodynamics of flapping flight reveals fundamental differences in the mechanisms of aerodynamic force generation between fixed and flapping wings. When fixed wings translate at high angles of attack, they periodically generate and shed leading and trailing edge vortices as reflected in their fluctuating aerodynamic force traces and associated flow visualization. In contrast, wings flapping at high angles of attack generate stable leading edge vorticity, which persists throughout the duration of the stroke and enhances mean aerodynamic forces. Here, we show that aerodynamic forces can be controlled by altering the trailing edge flexibility of a flapping wing. We used a dynamically scaled mechanical model of flapping flight (Re approximately 2000) to measure the aerodynamic forces on flapping wings of variable flexural stiffness (EI). For low to medium angles of attack, as flexibility of the wing increases, its ability to generate aerodynamic forces decreases monotonically but its lift-to-drag ratios remain approximately constant. The instantaneous force traces reveal no major differences in the underlying modes of force generation for flexible and rigid wings, but the magnitude of force, the angle of net force vector and centre of pressure all vary systematically with wing flexibility. Even a rudimentary framework of wing veins is sufficient to restore the ability of flexible wings to generate forces at near-rigid values. Thus, the magnitude of force generation can be controlled by modulating the trailing edge flexibility and thereby controlling the magnitude of the leading edge vorticity. To characterize this, we have generated a detailed database of aerodynamic forces as a function of several variables including material properties, kinematics, aerodynamic forces and centre of pressure, which can also be used to help validate computational models of aeroelastic flapping wings. These experiments will also be useful for wing design for small robotic insects and, to a limited extent, in understanding the aerodynamics of flapping insect wings.},

abstract = {Insect wings can undergo significant chordwise (camber) as well as spanwise (twist) deformation during flapping flight but the effect of these deformations is not well understood. The shape and size of butterfly wings leads to particularly large wing deformations, making them an ideal test case for investigation of these effects. Here we use computational models derived from experiments on free-flying butterflies to understand the effect of time-varying twist and camber on the aerodynamic performance of these insects. High-speed videogrammetry is used to capture the wing kinematics, including deformation, of a Painted Lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui) in untethered, forward flight. These experimental results are then analyzed computationally using a high-fidelity, three-dimensional, unsteady Navier-Stokes flow solver. For comparison to this case, a set of non-deforming, flat-plate wing (FPW) models of wing motion are synthesized and subjected to the same analysis along with a wing model that matches the time-varying wing-twist observed for the butterfly, but has no deformation in camber. The simulations show that the observed butterfly wing (OBW) outperforms all the flat-plate wings in terms of usable force production as well as the ratio of lift to power by at least 29{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively. This increase in efficiency of lift production is at least three-fold greater than reported for other insects. Interestingly, we also find that the twist-only-wing (TOW) model recovers much of the performance of the OBW, demonstrating that wing-twist, and not camber is key to forward flight in these insects. The implications of this on the design of flapping wing micro-aerial vehicles are discussed.},

abstract = {Elevator Group Supervisory Control System (EGSCS) is a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization problem. Due to its vast state space, significant uncertainty and numerous resource constraints such as finite car capacities and registered hall/car calls, it is hard to manage EGSCS using conventional control methods. Recently, many solutions for EGSCS using Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have been reported. Genetic Network Programming (GNP), which is proposed as a new evolutionary computation method several years ago, is also proved to be efficient when applied to EGSCS problem. In this paper, we propose an extended algorithm for EGSCS by introducing Reinforcement Learning (RL) into GNP framework, and an improvement of the EGSCS' performances is expected since the efficiency of GNP with RL has been clarified in some other studies like tile-world problem. Simulation tests using traffic flows in a typical office building have been made, and the results show an actual improvement of 
the EGSCS' performances comparing to the algorithms using original GNP and conventional control methods. Furthermore, as a further study, an importance weight optimization algorithm is employed based on GNP with RL and its efficiency is also verified with the better performances.},

It provides the background necessary to do research in that area. Furthermore, it raises questions that need to be addressed in the future. The three main blocks constituting the flight dynamic framework of flapping MAVs are reviewed. These blocks are the flapping kinematics, the aerodynamic modeling, and the body dynamics. The design and parametrization of the flapping kinematics necessary to produce high-control authority over the MAV, as well as design of kinematics suitable for different flight conditions, are reviewed. Aerodynamic models used for analysis of flapping flight are discussed. Particular attention is given to the physical aspects captured by these models. The issues and consequences of averaging the dynamics and neglecting the wing inertia are discussed. The dynamic stability analysis of flapping MAVs is usually performed 
by either averaging, linearization and subsequent analysis or using Floquet theory. Both approaches are discussed. The linear and nonlinear control design techniques for flapping MAVs are also reviewed and discussed. {\&}copy; Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.},

@article{Taylor2001,
abstract = {Insects have evolved sophisticated fight control mechanisms permitting a remarkable range of manoeuvres. Here, I present a qualitative analysis of insect flight control from the perspective of flight mechanics, drawing upon both the neurophysiology and biomechanics literatures. The current literature does not permit a formal, quantitative analysis of flight control, because the aerodynamic force systems that biologists have measured have rarely been complete and the position of the centre of gravity has only been recorded in a few studies. Treating the two best-known insect orders (Diptera and Orthoptera) separately from other insects, I discuss the control mechanisms of different insects in detail. Recent experimental studies suggest that the helicopter model of flight control proposed for Drosophila spp. may be better thought of as a facultative strategy for flight control, rather than the fixed (albeit selected) constraint that it is usually interpreted to be. On the other hand, the so-called 'constant-lift reaction' of locusts appears not to be a reflex for maintaining constant lift at varying angles of attack, as is usually assumed, but rather a mechanism to restore the insect to pitch equilibrium following a disturbance. Differences in the kinematic control mechanisms used by the various insect orders are related to differences in the arrangement of the wings, the construction of the flight motor and the unsteady mechanisms of lift production that are used. Since the evolution of insect flight control is likely to have paralleled the evolutionary refinement of these unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms, taxonomic differences in the kinematics of control could provide an assay of the relative importance of different unsteady mechanisms. Although the control kinematics vary widely between orders, the number of degrees of freedom that different insects can control will always be limited by the number of independent control inputs that they use. Control of the moments about all three axes (as used by most conventional aircraft) has only been proven for larger flies and dragonflies, but is likely to be widespread in insects given the number of independent control inputs available to them. Unlike in conventional aircraft, however, insects' control inputs are likely to be highly non-orthogonal, and this will tend to complicate the neural processing required to separate the various motions.},

abstract = {The flight of a butterfly, Pieris melete, was observed in the take-off phase and was analyzed theoretically from aerodynamic and kinetic viewpoints. A vortex method, which was recently developed by the present authors, was used in this analysis. During the downstroke, the butterfly generates mainly a vertical force. The acceleration of the butterflys body during the first half of the downstroke is especially large, and this acceleration is mainly caused by a large unsteady pressure drag acting on the wings. This large unsteady pressure drag is generated by the vortices shed into the flow from the outer edges of each wing of a pair; it is increased by the interference effect between a pair of wings when the opening angle is small. This force can be estimated by the previous quasi-steady analysis when the force coefficient is changed to 4. In addition to the unsteady pressure drag, an aerodynamic force due to added mass is generated and this is also increased by the interference effect between a pair of wings. During the upstroke the butterfly generates mainly a horizontal force. The change of direction of the forces during the down- and upstrokes is controlled by variation in the inclination of the stroke plane. The moment, which is created by the aerodynamic force acting on the wings and by abdominal motion, changes the thoracic angle, that is the inclination of the stroke plane. Introduction},

abstract = {The reconfigurable, flapping wings of birds allow for both inertial and aerodynamic modes of reorientation. We found evidence that both these modes play important roles in the low speed turning flight of the rose-breasted cockatoo Eolophus roseicapillus. Using three-dimensional kinematics recorded from six cockatoos making a 90 degrees turn in a flight corridor, we developed predictions of inertial and aerodynamic reorientation from estimates of wing moments of inertia and flapping arcs, and a blade-element aerodynamic model. The blade-element model successfully predicted weight support (predicted was 88+/-17{\%} of observed, N=6) and centripetal force (predicted was 79+/-29{\%} of observed, N=6) for the maneuvering cockatoos and provided a reasonable estimate of mechanical power. The estimated torque from the model was a significant predictor of roll acceleration (r(2)=0.55, P{\textless}0.00001), but greatly overestimated roll magnitude when applied with no roll damping. Non-dimensional roll damping coefficients of approximately -1.5, 2-6 times greater than those typical of airplane flight dynamics (approximately -0.45), were required to bring our estimates of reorientation due to aerodynamic torque back into conjunction with the measured changes in orientation. Our estimates of inertial reorientation were statistically significant predictors of the measured reorientation within wingbeats (r(2) from 0.2 to 0.37, P{\textless}0.0005). Components of both our inertial reorientation and aerodynamic torque estimates correlated, significantly, with asymmetries in the activation profile of four flight muscles: the pectoralis, supracoracoideus, biceps brachii and extensor metacarpi radialis (r(2) from 0.27 to 0.45, P{\textless}0.005). Thus, avian flight maneuvers rely on production of asymmetries throughout the flight apparatus rather than in a specific set of control or turning muscles.},

Delayed stall functions during the translational portions of the stroke, when the wings sweep through the air with a large angle of attack. In contrast, rotational circulation and wake capture generate aerodynamic forces during stroke reversals, when the wings rapidly rotate and change direction. In addition to contributing to the lift required to keep an insect aloft, these two rotational mechanisms provide a potent means by which the animal can modulate the direction and magnitude of flight forces during steering maneuvers. A comprehensive theory incorporating both translational and rotational mechanisms may explain the diverse patterns of wing motion displayed by different species of insects.},

abstract = {Our understanding of how variable wind in natural environments affects flying insects is limited because most studies of insect flight are conducted in either smooth flow or still air conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of structured, unsteady flow (the von Karman vortex street behind a cylinder) on the flight performance of bumblebees (Bombus impatiens). Bumblebees are 'all-weather' foragers and thus frequently experience variable aerial conditions, ranging from fully mixed, turbulent flow to unsteady, structured vortices near objects such as branches and stems. We examined how bumblebee flight performance differs in unsteady versus smooth flow, as well as how the orientation of unsteady flow structures affects their flight performance, by filming bumblebees flying in a wind tunnel under various flow conditions. The three-dimensional flight trajectories and orientations of bumblebees were quantified in each of three flow conditions: (1) smooth flow, (2) the unsteady wake of a vertical cylinder (inducing strong lateral disturbances) and (3) the unsteady wake of a horizontal cylinder (inducing strong vertical disturbances). In both unsteady conditions, bumblebees attenuated the disturbances induced by the wind quite effectively, but still experienced significant translational and rotational fluctuations as compared with flight in smooth flow. Bees appeared to be most sensitive to disturbance along the lateral axis, displaying large lateral accelerations, translations and rolling motions in response to both unsteady flow conditions, regardless of orientation. Bees also displayed the greatest agility around the roll axis, initiating voluntary casting maneuvers and correcting for lateral disturbances mainly through roll in all flow conditions. Both unsteady flow conditions reduced the upstream flight speed of bees, suggesting an increased cost of flight in unsteady flow, with potential implications for foraging patterns and colony energetics in natural, variable wind environments.},

abstract = {1. Expressions have been derived for an estimate of the average coefficient of lift, for the variation in bending moment or torque caused by wind forces and by inertia forces, and for the power output during hovering flight on one spot when the wings move according to a horizontal figure-of-eight. 2. In both hummingbirds and Drosophila the flight is consistent with steady-state aerodynamics, the average lift coefficient being 1.8 in the hummingbird and 0.8 in Drosophila. 3. The aerodynamic or hydraulic efficiency is 0.5 in the hummingbird and 0.3 in Drosophila, and in both types the aerodynamic power output is 22-24 cal/g body weight/h. 4. The total mechanical power output is 39 cal g-1 h-1 in the hummingbird because of the extra energy needed to accelerate the wing-mass. It is 24 cal g-1 h-1 in Drosophila in which the inertia term is negligible because the wing-stroke frequency is reduced to the lowest possible value for sustained flight. 5. In both animals the mechanical efficiency of the flight muscles is 0.2. 6. It is argued that the tilt of the stroke plane relative to the horizontal is an adaptation to the geometrically unfavourable induced wind and to the relatively large lift/drag ratio seen in many insects. The vertical movements at the extreme ends may serve to reduce the interaction between the shed ‘stopping' vortex and the new bound vortex of opposite sense which has to be built up during the early part of the return stroke. 7. Two additional non-steady flow situations may exist at either end of the stroke, delayed stall and delayed build-up of circulation (Wagner effect), but since they have opposite effects it is probable that the resultant force is of about the same magnitude as that estimated for a steady-state situation. 8. Most insects have an effective elastic system to counteract the adverse effect of wing-inertia, but small fast-moving vertebrates have not. It is argued that the only material available for this purpose in this group is elastin and that it is unsuited at the rates of deformation required because recent measurements have shown that the damping is relatively high, probably due to molecular factors.},

abstract = {Insects produce a variety of exquisitely controlled manoeuvres during natural flight behaviour. Here we show how hawkmoths produce and control one such manoeuvre, an avoidance response consisting of rapid pitching up, rearward flight, pitching down (often past the original pitch angle), and then pitching up slowly to equilibrium. We triggered these manoeuvres via a sudden visual stimulus in front of free-flying hawkmoths (Manduca sexta) while recording the animals' body and wing movements via high-speed stereo videography. We then recreated the wing motions in a dynamically scaled model to: (1) associate wing kinematic changes with pitch torque production and (2) extract the open-loop dynamics of an uncontrolled moth. Next, we characterized the closed-loop manoeuvring dynamics from the observed flight behaviour assuming that hawkmoths use feedback control based on translational velocity, pitch angle and angular velocity, and then compared these with the open-loop dynamics to identify the control strategy used by the moth. Our analysis revealed that hawkmoths produce active pitch torque via changes in mean wing spanwise rotation angle. Additionally, body translations produce passive translational damping and pitch torque, both of which are linearly dependent on the translational velocity. Body rotations produce similar passive forces and torques, but of substantially smaller magnitudes. Our comparison of closed-loop and open-loop dynamics showed that hawkmoths rely largely on passive damping to reduce the body translation but use feedback control based on pitch angle and angular velocity to control their orientation. The resulting feedback control system remains stable with sensory delays of more than two wingbeats.},

@article{Sane2001,
abstract = {We used a dynamically scaled mechanical model of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to study how changes in wing kinematics influence the production of unsteady aerodynamic forces in insect flight. We examined 191 separate sets of kinematic patterns that differed with respect to stroke amplitude, angle of attack, flip timing, flip duration and the shape and magnitude of stroke deviation. Instantaneous aerodynamic forces were measured using a two-dimensional force sensor mounted at the base of the wing. The influence of unsteady rotational effects was assessed by comparing the time course of measured forces with that of corresponding translational quasi-steady estimates. For each pattern, we also calculated mean stroke-averaged values of the force coefficients and an estimate of profile power. The results of this analysis may be divided into four main points. (i) For a short, symmetrical wing flip, mean lift was optimized by a stroke amplitude of 180 degrees and an angle of attack of 50 degrees. At all stroke amplitudes, mean drag increased monotonically with increasing angle of attack. Translational quasi-steady predictions better matched the measured values at high stroke amplitude than at low stroke amplitude. This discrepancy was due to the increasing importance of rotational mechanisms in kinematic patterns with low stroke amplitude. (ii) For a 180 degrees stroke amplitude and a 45 degrees angle of attack, lift was maximized by short-duration flips occurring just slightly in advance of stroke reversal. Symmetrical rotations produced similarly high performance. Wing rotation that occurred after stroke reversal, however, produced very low mean lift. (iii) The production of aerodynamic forces was sensitive to changes in the magnitude of the wing's deviation from the mean stroke plane (stroke deviation) as well as to the actual shape of the wing tip trajectory. However, in all examples, stroke deviation lowered aerodynamic performance relative to the no deviation case. This attenuation was due, in part, to a trade-off between lift and a radially directed component of total aerodynamic force. Thus, while we found no evidence that stroke deviation can augment lift, it nevertheless may be used to modulate forces on the two wings. Thus, insects might use such changes in wing kinematics during steering maneuvers to generate appropriate force moments. (iv) While quasi-steady estimates failed to capture the time course of measured lift for nearly all kinematic patterns, they did predict with reasonable accuracy stroke-averaged values for the mean lift coefficient. However, quasi-steady estimates grossly underestimated the magnitude of the mean drag coefficient under all conditions. This discrepancy was due to the contribution of rotational effects that steady-state estimates do not capture. This result suggests that many prior estimates of mechanical power based on wing kinematics may have been grossly underestimated.},

abstract = {The derivation of the nonlinear dynamics of flapping wing micro air vehicles is presented. Simulation results investigate differences in the position and orientation of the body due to differing wing masses and aerodynamic modeling choices. The flapping wing micro air vehicle is modeled as a system of three rigid bodies: a body and two wings. The mass of the wings, and their associated mass and inertial effects on the body, are thoroughly analyzed and included. Simulations are compared with previous modeling efforts, which neglected the wings' mass and the associated inertial coupling effects on the body. Simulations show a qualitative consistency for the nonlinear model with wing effects when different aerodynamic models are chosen as inputs. Simulation results show a significant difference in the model behavior when the mass of the wings, initially set at 5.7{\%} of the body mass, is included versus when the mass is neglected. As the mass of the wings is decreased, the simulation results of the model with wing effects approach the results when the standard aircraft model is used. Simulations lead to the conclusion that the mass effects of the wings are important for dynamics, stability, and control analyses.},

However, direct application of the averaging theorem may lead to false conclusions about the dynamics and stability of hovering insects and FWMAVs. Higher-order averaging techniques may be needed to understand the dynamics of flapping wing flight and to analyze its stability. We use second-order averaging to analyze the hovering dynamics of five insects in response to high-amplitude, high-frequency, periodic wing motion.

abstract = {Monarch butterflies from eastern North America migrate each fall to high altitude habitats in central Mexico and must avoid freezing, desiccation, heat stress, and predation while drawing on unrenewable lipid reserves for at least 90 d. Survival involves a heatgaining morphology and behaviors in which thermoregulation plays a central role. Heat production by shivering permits raising of thoracic temperatures sufficiently for the butterflies to crawl up vegetation to sunbask where they warm rapidly to flight threshold (12.716.0C). Shivering and basking can also achieve or maintain flight temperature during partly cloudly weather. Both behaviors delay the decline of thoracic temperatures below flight threshold and consequent thermal trapping either on the ground beneath clusters of other monarchs, or while the butterflies are at water or nectar sources. The monarch thus is the first butterfly in which shivering has been shown to be of major ecological importance. At the other end of the thermal spectrum, basking in the intense insolation at this lattitude causes rapid warming at ambient temperatures as low as 9. To avoid overheating and rapid depletion, the butterflies adopt summinimizing postures or fly out of insolated clusters and glide above the colony, losing heat to the cold ambient. Calculations suggest that a large proportion of the butterfies dies from depleting lipid stores. Maintenance of low body temperatures to conseve lipids is one of the major reasons why migrant monarchs select these high mountain forest as their overwinterin habitat.},

abstract = {The longitudinal dynamic flight stability of a hovering bumblebee was studied using the method of computational fluid dynamics to compute the aerodynamic derivatives and the techniques of eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis for solving the equations of motion. For the longitudinal disturbed motion, three natural modes were identified: one unstable oscillatory mode, one stable fast subsidence mode and one stable slow subsidence mode. The unstable oscillatory mode consists of pitching and horizontal moving oscillations with negligible vertical motion. The period of the oscillations is 0.32 s (approx. 50 times the wingbeat period of the bumblebee). The oscillations double in amplitude in 0.1 s; coupling of nose-up pitching with forward horizontal motion (and nose-down pitching with backward horizontal motion) in this mode causes the instability. The stable fast subsidence mode consists of monotonic pitching and horizontal motions, which decay to half of the starting values in 0.024 s. The stable slow subsidence mode is mainly a monotonic descending (or ascending) motion, which decays to half of its starting value in 0.37 s. Due to the unstable oscillatory mode, the hovering flight of the bumblebee is dynamically unstable. However, the instability might not be a great problem to a bumblebee that tries to stay hovering: the time for the initial disturbances to double (0.1 s) is more than 15 times the wingbeat period (6.4 ms), and the bumblebee has plenty of time to adjust its wing motion before the disturbances grow large.},

Here, we use a self-propelled flapping-wing model mounted on a merry go round to investigate the effect of wing compliance on the propulsive efficiency of the system. Our measurements show that the elastic nature of the wings can lead not only to a substantial reduction in the consumed power, but also to an increment of the propulsive force. A scaling analysis using a flexible plate model for the wings points out that, for flapping flyers in air, the time-dependent shape of the elastic bending wing is governed by the wing inertia. Based on this prediction, we define the ratio of the inertial forces deforming the wing to the elastic restoring force that limits the deformation as the elastoinertial number N(ei). Our measurements with the self-propelled model confirm that it is the appropriate structural parameter to describe flapping flyers with flexible wings.},

@article{Sane2003,
abstract = {The flight of insects has fascinated physicists and biologists for more than a century. Yet, until recently, researchers were unable to rigorously quantify the complex wing motions of flapping insects or measure the forces and flows around their wings. However, recent developments in high-speed videography and tools for computational and mechanical modeling have allowed researchers to make rapid progress in advancing our understanding of insect flight. These mechanical and computational fluid dynamic models, combined with modern flow visualization techniques, have revealed that the fluid dynamic phenomena underlying flapping flight are different from those of non-flapping, 2-D wings on which most previous models were based. In particular, even at high angles of attack, a prominent leading edge vortex remains stably attached on the insect wing and does not shed into an unsteady wake, as would be expected from non-flapping 2-D wings. Its presence greatly enhances the forces generated by the wing, thus enabling insects to hover or maneuver. In addition, flight forces are further enhanced by other mechanisms acting during changes in angle of attack, especially at stroke reversal, the mutual interaction of the two wings at dorsal stroke reversal or wing-wake interactions following stroke reversal. This progress has enabled the development of simple analytical and empirical models that allow us to calculate the instantaneous forces on flapping insect wings more accurately than was previously possible. It also promises to foster new and exciting multi-disciplinary collaborations between physicists who seek to explain the phenomenology, biologists who seek to understand its relevance to insect physiology and evolution, and engineers who are inspired to build micro-robotic insects using these principles. This review covers the basic physical principles underlying flapping flight in insects, results of recent experiments concerning the aerodynamics of insect flight, as well as the different approaches used to model these phenomena.},

abstract = {During flight, the wings of many insects undergo considerable shape changes in spanwise and chordwise directions. We determined the origin of spanwise wing deformation by combining measurements on segmental wing stiffness of the blowfly Calliphora vicina in the ventral and dorsal directions with numerical modelling of instantaneous aerodynamic and inertial forces within the stroke cycle using a two-dimensional unsteady blade elementary approach. We completed this approach by an experimental study on the wing's rotational axis during stroke reversal. The wing's local flexural stiffness ranges from 30 to 40 nN m(2) near the root, whereas the distal wing parts are highly compliant (0.6 to 2.2 nN m(2)). Local bending moments during wing flapping peak near the wing root at the beginning of each half stroke due to both aerodynamic and inertial forces, producing a maximum wing tip deflection of up to 46 deg. Blowfly wings store up to 2.30 $\mu$J elastic potential energy that converts into a mean wing deformation power of 27.3 $\mu$W. This value equates to approximately 5.9 and 2.3{\%} of the inertial and aerodynamic power requirements for flight in this animal, respectively. Wing elasticity measurements suggest that approximately 20{\%} or 0.46 $\mu$J of elastic potential energy cannot be recovered within each half stroke. Local strain energy increases from tip to root, matching the distribution of the wing's elastic protein resilin, whereas local strain energy density varies little in the spanwise direction. This study demonstrates a source of mechanical energy loss in fly flight owing to spanwise wing bending at the stroke reversals, even in cases in which aerodynamic power exceeds inertial power. Despite lower stiffness estimates, our findings are widely consistent with previous stiffness measurements on insect wings but highlight the relationship between local flexural stiffness, wing deformation power and energy expenditure in flapping insect wings.},

abstract = {Insect wings are deformable structures that change shape passively and dynamically owing to inertial and aerodynamic forces during flight. It is still unclear how the three-dimensional and passive change of wing kinematics owing to inherent wing flexibility contributes to unsteady aerodynamics and energetics in insect flapping flight. Here, we perform a systematic fluid-structure interaction based analysis on the aerodynamic performance of a hovering hawkmoth, Manduca, with an integrated computational model of a hovering insect with rigid and flexible wings. Aerodynamic performance of flapping wings with passive deformation or prescribed deformation is evaluated in terms of aerodynamic force, power and efficiency. Our results reveal that wing flexibility can increase downwash in wake and hence aerodynamic force: first, a dynamic wing bending is observed, which delays the breakdown of leading edge vortex near the wing tip, responsible for augmenting the aerodynamic force-production; second, a combination of the dynamic change of wing bending and twist favourably modifies the wing kinematics in the distal area, which leads to the aerodynamic force enhancement immediately before stroke reversal. Moreover, an increase in hovering efficiency of the flexible wing is achieved as a result of the wing twist. An extensive study of wing stiffness effect on aerodynamic performance is further conducted through a tuning of Young's modulus and thickness, indicating that insect wing structures may be optimized not only in terms of aerodynamic performance but also dependent on many factors, such as the wing strength, the circulation capability of wing veins and the control of wing movements.},

@article{Wei73,
abstract = {1. On the assumption that steady-state aerodynamics applies, simple analytical expressions are derived for the average lift coefficient, Reynolds number, the aerodynamic power, the moment of inertia of the wing mass and the dynamic efficiency in animals which perform normal hovering with horizontally beating wings.2. The majority of hovering animals, including large lamellicorn beetles and sphingid moths, depend mainly on normal aerofoil action. However, in some groups with wing loading less than 10 N m-2 (1 kgf m-2), non-steady aerodynamics must play a major role, namely in very small insects at low Reynolds number, in true hover-flies (Syrphinae), in large dragonflies (Odonata) and in many butterflies (Lepidoptera Rhopalocera).3. The specific aerodynamic power ranges between 1.3 and 4.7 WN-1 (11-40 cal h-1 gf-1) but power output does not vary systematically with size, inter alia because the lift/drag ratio deteriorates at low Reynolds number.4. Comparisons between metabolic rate, aerodynamic power and dynamic efficiency show that the majority of insects require and depend upon an effective elastic system in the thorax which counteracts the bending moments caused by wing inertia.5. The free flight of a very small chalcid wasp Encarsia formosa has been analysed by means of slow-motion films. At this low Reynolds number (10-20), the high lift co-efficient of 2 or 3 is not possible with steady-state aerodynamics and the wasp must depend almost entirely on non-steady flow patterns.6. The wings of Encarsia are moved almost horizontally during hovering, the body being vertical, and there are three unusual phases in the wing stroke: the clap, the fling and the flip. In the clap the wings are brought together at the top of the morphological upstroke. In the fling, which is a pronation at the beginning of the morphological downstroke, the opposed wings are flung open like a book, hinging about their posterior margins. In the flip, which is a supination at the beginning of the morphological upstroke, the wings are rapidly twisted through about 180°.7. The fling is a hitherto undescribed mechanism for creating lift and for setting up the appropriate circulation over the wing in anticipation of the downstroke. In the case of Encarsia the calculated and observed wing velocities at which lift equals body weight are in agreement, and lift is produced almost instantaneously from the beginning of the downstroke and without any Wagner effect. The fling mechanism seems to be involved in the normal flight of butterflies and possibly of Drosophila and other small insects. Dimensional and other considerations show that it could be a useful mechanism in birds and bats during take-off and in emergencies.8. The flip is also believed to be a means of setting up an appropriate circulation around the wing, which has hitherto escaped attention; but its operation is less well understood. It is not confined to Encarsia but operates in other insects, not only at the beginning of the upstroke (supination) but also at the beginning of the downstroke where a flip (pronation) replaces the clap and fling of Encarsia. A study of freely flying hover-flies strongly indicates that the Syrphinae (and Odonata) depend almost entirely upon the flip mechanism when hovering. In the case of these insects a transient circulation is presumed to be set up before the translation of the wing through the air, by the rapid pronation (or supination) which affects the stiff anterior margin before the soft posterior portions of the wing. In the flip mechanism vortices of opposite sense must be shed, and a Wagner effect must be present.9. In some hovering insects the wing twistings occur so rapidly that the speed of propagation of the elastic torsional wave from base to tip plays a significant role and appears to introduce beneficial effects.10. Non-steady periods, particularly flip effects, are present in all flapping animals and they will modify and become superimposed upon the steady-state pattern as described by the mathematical model presented here. However, the accumulated evidence indicates that the majority of hovering animals conform reasonably well with that model.11. Many new types of analysis are indicated in the text and are now open for future theoretical and experimental research.},

abstract = {Insect wings in flight typically deform under the combined aerodynamic force and wing inertia; whichever is dominant depends on the mass ratio defined as m ∗ = $\rho$ s h / ( $\rho$ f c ) , where $\rho$ s h is the surface density of the wing, $\rho$ f is the density of the air, and c is the characteristic length of the wing. To study the differences that the wing inertia makes in the aerodynamic performance of the deformable wing, a two-dimensional numerical study is applied to simulate the flow-structure interaction of a flapping wing during hovering flight. The wing section is modeled as an elastic plate, which may experience nonlinear deformations while flapping. The effect of the wing inertia on lift production, drag resistance, and power consumption is studied for a range of wing rigidity. It is found that both inertia-induced deformation and flow-induced deformation can enhance lift of the wing. However, the flow-induced deformation, which corresponds to the low-mass wing, produces less drag and leads to higher aerodynamic power efficiency. In addition, the wing deformation has a significant effect on the unsteady vortices around the wing. The implication of the findings on insect flight is discussed.},

abstract = {We consider a combined experimental (based on flow visualization, direct force measurement and phase-averaged 2D particle image velocimetry in a water tunnel), computational (2D Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes) and theoretical (Theodorsen's formula) approach to study the fluid physics of rigid-airfoil pitch–plunge in nominally two-dimensional conditions. Shallow-stall (combined pitch–plunge) and deep-stall (pure-plunge) are compared at a reduced frequency commensurate with flapping-flight in cruise in nature. Objectives include assessment of how well attached-flow theory can predict lift coefficient even in the presence of significant separation, and how well 2D velocimetry and 2D computation can mutually validate one another. The shallow-stall case shows promising agreement between computation and experiment, while in the deep-stall case, the computation's prediction of flow separation lags that of the experiment, but eventually evinces qualitatively similar leading edge vortex size. Dye injection was found to give good qualitative match with particle image velocimetry in describing leading edge vortex formation and return to flow reattachment, and also gave evidence of strong spanwise growth of flow separation after leading-edge vortex formation. Reynolds number effects, in the range of 10,000–60,000, were found to influence the size of laminar separation in those phases of motion where instantaneous angle of attack was well below stall, but have limited effect on post-stall flowfield behavior. Discrepancy in lift coefficient time history between experiment, theory and computation was mutually comparable, with no clear failure of Theodorsen's formula. This is surprising and encouraging, especially for the deep-stall case, because the theory's assumptions are clearly violated, while its prediction of lift coefficient remains useful for capturing general trends.},

abstract = {Flying insects have evolved sophisticated sensory-motor systems, and here we argue that such systems are used to keep upright against intrinsic flight instabilities. We describe a theory that predicts the instability growth rate in body pitch from flapping-wing aerodynamics and reveals two ways of achieving balanced flight: active control with sufficiently rapid reactions and passive stabilization with high body drag. By glueing magnets to fruit flies and perturbing their flight using magnetic impulses, we show that these insects employ active control that is indeed fast relative to the instability. Moreover, we find that fruit flies with their control sensors disabled can keep upright if high-drag fibres are also attached to their bodies, an observation consistent with our prediction for the passive stability condition. Finally, we extend this framework to unify the control strategies used by hovering animals and also furnish criteria for achieving pitch stability in flapping-wing robots.},

abstract = {Wing and body kinematics of free cruising flight are described for 37 species of Panamanian butterflies ranging over two orders of magnitude in body mass. Butterflies exhibit considerable diversity in body and wing shape, but morphological design is, in general, isometric. Wing loading and mean body diameter show positive allometry. The cruising flight of butterflies is characterized by low wingbeat frequencies (here averaging 11 Hz), stroke amplitudes averaging 103°, and forward speeds in excess of 1 m/s. Body angles during flight are close to horizontal, and stroke plane angles are correspondingly high. Advance ratios are typically greater than 0.9, indicating that the forward and flapping velocity vectors are of comparable magnitude. Flight speed scales with morphological parameters in general accordance with predictions based on isometric design. Interspecifically, no consistent correlation exists between wing kinematics and absolute flight speed. However, maximum positional angle and stroke amplitude tend to increase while body angle decreases with increased relative flight speed.},

abstract = {Due to their small size and flight regime, coupling of aerodynamics, structural dynamics, and flight dynamics is critical for Micro Aerial Vehicles. This paper presents a computational framework for simulating structural models of varied fidelity and a Navier-Stokes solver, aimed at simulating flapping and flexible wings. The structural model utilizes either (i) the in-house developed UM/NLABS, which decomposes the equations of 3-D elasticity into cross-sectional and spanwise analyses for slender wings; or (ii) MSC.Marc, which is a commercial finite element solver capable of modeling geometrically-nonlinear structures of arbitrary geometry. The flow solver employs a well tested pressure-based algorithm implemented in STREAM. A NACA0012 cross-section rectangular wing of aspect ratio 3, chord Reynolds number of 3x104, and reduced frequency varying from 0.4 to 1.82 is investigated. Both rigid and flexible wing results are presented and good agreement between experiment and computation are shown regarding tip displacement and thrust coefficient. Issues related to coupling strategies, fluid physics associated with rigid and flexible wings, and implications of fluid density on aerodynamic loading are also explored in this paper.},

The resulting high-fidelity aeroelastic solver is applied to the investigation of rigid, moderately flexible and highly flexible rectangular wings undergoing a pure plunging motion. Comparisons of the computed results with available experimental measurements demonstrate good agreement. A description of the complex interaction between the unsteady aerodynamics and the flexible wing structural dynamics is given. Connections between the results of this analysis and enhanced loads for the moderately flexible wing are made. Results presented suggest that an optimum amount of flexibility exists for the case of a plunging wing and is associated with wing motions where the wing tip deflection and wing root motion are in phase over much of the plunge cycle. ?? 2013.},

abstract = {Flying animals exhibit remarkable capabilities for both generating maneuvers and stabilizing their course and orientation after perturbation. Here we show that flapping fliers ranging in size from fruit flies to large birds benefit from substantial damping of angular velocity through a passive mechanism termed flapping counter-torque (FCT). Our FCT model predicts that isometrically scaled animals experience similar damping on a per-wingbeat time scale, resulting in similar turning dynamics in wingbeat time regardless of body size. The model also shows how animals may simultaneously specialize in both maneuverability and stability (at the cost of efficiency) and provides a framework for linking morphology, wing kinematics, maneuverability, and flight dynamics across a wide range of flying animals spanning insects, bats, and birds.},

abstract = {A control strategy is proposed for a minimally-actuated flapping-wing micro air-vehicle (FWMAV). The proposed vehicle is similar to the Harvard RoboFly that accomplished the first takeoff of an insect scale flapping wing aircraft, except that it is equipped with independently actuated wings. Using the derivation of the aerodynamic forces and moments from Part I, a control allocation strategy and a feedback control law are designed that enable the vehicle to achieve untethered, stabilized flight about a hover condition. Six degree-of-freedom maneuvers near hover are demonstrated as well. The control laws are designed to make use of two actuators that control the angular position of the wing in the stroke plane. The Split-Cycle Constant-Period Frequency Modulation with Wing Bias technique, introduced in Part I, is used to allow each wing to generate non-zero cycle-averaged aerodynamic forces and moments. This technique modifies the frequencies of the up and down strokes to yield non-zero cycle-
averaged drag due to the flapping motion of a wing. Additionally, the midpoint of the wingbeat profile can be modified by use of a wing bias. The bias is introduced to primarily provide pitching moment control. In this work, the sensitivities of cycle-averaged forces and moments with respect to the control parameters are computed. Single axis controllers are designed and the complete system is simulated.},

abstract = {To gain some more understanding of the flapping wing aerodynamics and aeroelasticity associated with biological flyers and micro air vehicles (MAVs), a combined computational and experimental study of a well characterized flapping wing structure was conducted. In particular, the coupling between aerodynamics and structural dynamics plays an important role in such flyers but to date has not been adequately addressed. An aeroelasticity framework based on a co-rotational shell finite element solver with a Navier-Stokes solver is developed. Experimentally, a customized digital image correlation system measures the wing deformation, a load sensor attached to the flapping mechanism records the forces produced by the flapping motion, and a stereo digital particle image velocimetry measures the flow velocities. Computational efforts with insight into the fluid physics are reported. Relevant fluid physics are documented including the counter-rotating vortices at the leading and the trailing edge which interact with the tip vortex during the wing motion. Overall, good correlations between experiment and computation are attained. Furthermore, studies on hypothetical flexible flapping wing configurations showed that wing flexibility can be tailored to alter the aerodynamics of a flapping wing. 2010 by the authors.},

abstract = {Motivated by the discovery that living creatures may be able to enhance their locomotion capability through passive or active deformations of their wings or fins, we carry out a fully coupled fluid–structure interaction study to investigate the flapping motion of a foil with either chordwise or spanwise flexibility. We employ a fluid–structure interaction model, which accounts for fluid dynamics using the boundary-element method and structural dynamics using a two-dimensional nonlinear thin-plate model. With this approach, we numerically investigate the effect of structural deformation on the performance of the foil when it is immersed in two different fluids, a low-density fluid (e.g., air), in which the deformation is determined primarily by the inertia of the foil, and a high-density fluid (e.g., water), in which the fluid loading has a significant impact. In the first scenario, we find that the chordwise flexibility reduces both the thrust and the propulsion efficiency and the spanwise flexibility increases the thrust without efficiency reduction within a small range of structural parameters. In the second scenario, we find that the chordwise flexibility increases the efficiency. The spanwise flexibility, on the other hand, compromises the performance of the foil by diminishing both the thrust and the efficiency. Possible applications of these findings and their relation to designs in aquatic animals are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the design of the flight control algorithms for flapping wing micromechanical flying insects (MFIs). Inspired by the sensory feedback and neuromotor structure of insects, we propose a similar top-down hierarchical architecture to achieve high performance despite the MFIs' limited on-board computational resources. The flight stabilization problem is formulated as high-frequency periodic control of an underactuated system. In particular, we provide a methodology to approximate the time-varying dynamics caused by the aerodynamic forces with a time-invariant model using averaging theory and a biomimetic parametrization of the wing trajectories. This approximation leads to a simpler dynamical model that can be identified using experimental data from the on-board sensors and the voltage inputs to the wing actuators. The overall control law is a periodic proportional output feedback. Simulations, including sensor and actuator models, demonstrate stable flight in hovering mode. {\&}

We analyzed the aerodynamic consequences of wing deformation in locusts using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation based on detailed wing kinematics. We validated the simulation against smoke visualizations and digital particle image velocimetry on real locusts. We then used the validated model to explore the effects of wing topography and deformation, first by removing camber while keeping the same time-varying twist distribution, and second by removing camber and spanwise twist. The full-fidelity model achieved greater power economy than the uncambered model, which performed better than the untwisted model, showing that the details of insect wing topography and deformation are important aerodynamically. Such details are likely to be important in engineering applications of flapping flight.},
